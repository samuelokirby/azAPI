Im the only rapper that these people really care for
Youre the reason theres security in the airport
Id tell you to suck my dick but that might be racist
Plus I dont want to get my shit caught in your braces
Maybe you deserve those, youre tiny as fuck
You get to stay up on your feet when a dude needs his dick sucked
I know I got a lot of faults, Im aware of all that
But how you say you want beef when you allergic to that?
Fuck you, Its time to quit your bitchin
Imma put this shit on Worldstar with the title "White Boy Kills Brown Midget"
(Worldstar nigga sleep!)
Fuckin up with that haircut, head shaped like Spongebob
Youre trying to sell drugs like you think thats a fun job
Fuck that, and fuck you
Whens the last time you heard your parents say "I love you"
Hows it feel to know that I will always be above you
I aint talkin height now, Im talking on some other shit
Lyrics, Flow, Spiritual, Im always on some other shit
You say you get ass, but youre hooking up with Davids friends
After he is done with them and Baby J is sexting them
I could make a whole mixtape about you, thats some diss songs
My dude got suspended from his own prom
Cause he knew that he couldnt get a date to his own prom
But even David got one
How bout that
All these girls think youre cute
But not in a "date way"
More like an a "Oh, this little kid wants to play!" way
Well except for Mikayla, I heard you guys had a ball
But I was talking to Cristian, he said your penis was small

*beat drops*

You talk about ambition
Say youll make a lot of money one day
Think the journey is all games and fun
But when its all said and done
And Im successful and won
Youll end up working at Tonys
With your little pink gun
Running errands for David
Not even making a fraction of what Arash does

Youre up

You half a fool, you optimist
I see you like my optometrist
You talk about my girlfriend, but you aint never really had one
Well Emma in the backseat, but you aint never really had one
You say Im fat and all, but thats because youre scared and small
You never had no self esteem, had to build a twitter regime
To get some good feedback, cause in real life, you aint have that
I killed you in no time at all
Perfected rhymes and called you small
It took you twice the time as me to talk about some Adderall?
My response is half as long as yours, but this the most important verse
93, we with gardening tools
We all state, you aint starting fools
Took a dream from in my head, groomed it, grew it, now heres The End
Kasey is my dawg and all
Thats why hes KaseyBark, yanno
B Clark, Midgey, Durbsman, IceBox, Kimu, Labes, Billy
They been here since the start, but now its winding down around the bend
Thank you all for listing, this is The motherfucking End

I hear you talkin shit, bro you think youre the heat
Please bow down to defeat youre barely mince meat
Stop with the street talk, and start to do the street, walk
Lock yourself in and tell me this, how you gonna battle with this sick shit that I spit bitch
See you still flappin your jaws, prepare to be thrown in the ocean
In the middle with jaws
Or prefer to be served and severed with claws, knock on the doors Of absolute death you may
But please be ready for the automatic failures you may make
So take this and wait for another dismembering, remembering
The tethering of your dream and how it was minced to pieces
Believe in yourself please, to save you now youll be needin
Help from Jesus
You think Im copy, pastin please, tell me how youre actin up
Better be quite or Ima bout to bitch smack your mouth shut
For good, yeah man talk the hood talk better go back and walk the hood walk you aint had the taste of a real G
Get back down to your level and prepare to be beat
Writin on your sheet, like youre deep please bitch your weak
You aint on my level or a level at all, take a vacation
Up the damn wall and fall
Humpty Dumpty, I must be rusty but you better knock the shit Down if you goin against me
Im hard to beat, youre hardly cheese compared to these beats And this emcee
You ready, alright, so come on down, I bet you to do it
Lets see if you got the balls or if youre just truant
To me, yeah lets keep an eye, on your ass as the heat intensifies
Talk to me in a smart tone, prepare to meet your demise
Throw you, a hundred million miles is what Im finna do
Call me Son Goku
I already told you, what Im gonna do, finna plow through
Yeah man try to tackle a topic more intense then mine
I always rap from the heart, make the fake rappers sigh
But I really really dont give at all a flying fuck
My chance of making this shit is the same as seein a flyin truck
Or it could all depend on some serious luck
Maybe Ill release a track that is heard my millions
Make it big and to the top and make billions
But thats a dream for another day, Im here to take you down
Dont care what you say
Freestylin this rap shit to the grave
Rap battlin bitches in my spare time for loose change
Please, all of you fake ass rappers are plan
Make like like a plane and take the next trip away
Far away, from here I dont need to here your shit anymore
Im tired of it now, next place to be, will be a fuckin morgue
But let me just let you all know this, Im sick of it, all of it
So listen next time I write another track
Listen to the facts I spit, and find it through my old wack rap crap
I know Ive said some shit, that know I demise
But just look at my own and, your own life
But this time, through my eyes
I got a couple little bitches that need a little call out
But Ill reside, got more and more, dont get me wrong
Now get the fuck back home and call your mom
Continue to rap please, just leave me alone
Im done hearing wack disses like this
Im sick of this, listening to this petty as shit
Bitch


I said whats up homie? Welcome to your own lobotomy
You may have sent Dirtbag Dan back to local comedy but aint no one stopping me
We are World Domination 6, right? The whole globe is watching
Aint that about a bitch? Like a Rone biography

I said my dude, Im honestly happy for you
I thought youd never be the champ son
Shit, we six bars into this title match
and its already better than the last one

I mean Im way too advanced son I can do shit that youve never did
Thats why I gotta take his last breath before he get a second wind
I mean I heard you was gonna get personal with me, I mustve got in his head
Yall been begging for a king but instead you got a God in the flesh

You want your style...your style? Is as obvious as it gets
You rap like how bitches talk to their pets
Like, "Oh, you gon rap like this is things you gotta handle
Oh. You gon talk to Daniel like a Cocker Spaniel AARF!
Boy I catch you slipping on yo campus while you flannel
Boy I gotta choppa knock you out your socks and sandals!"

This so dont panic, your punches do no damage
Ill [?] turn your nose into nothing but bone fragments
Body blows, give him a bleeding heart like a hopeless romantic
Im nomadic, I leave Earth with no hope of going home to my own planet
You my bro Adam but that dont mean I wont got at him
Throw blows at him, bury him up to his throat and throw stones at him

You get cold feet? I toe tag you
You know that chrome Magnum
But that forehead cro magnum
My bullets hit you ricochet and hit Gully and Organik

I said they keep calling you a king but I think this king needs the boot
I mean honestly this whole chain needs a control+alt+delete and reboot
This guy called me a fucking "weed" man
But I think we can see the truth
I think hes just jealous of the weeds at least weeds has some roots

I mean my dude, you dressed up like fucking Abraham Lincoln trying to gain some views
And then you rapped about freeing slaves while all the black people tried to escape the room
The craziest shit is
Out of all the angles this lame could use
Its funny you dress like Abe Lincoln but youre the one getting the chain removed

Im way too smooth, you aint never been great
Lets face facts Adam Im already a legend today
But I swear to God the only thing black in your house is electrical tape
He probably calls the cops on his own shadow like, "Stop him. Hes getting away."

Youre a fucking faggot with no stripes

You wanna gamble but no dice
This fool Adam is so white he wont even reach in his bars
Hes had everything handed to him his whole life

I said, hell out write me and then out white me
You dont want to mess with dude
Hes never struggled a day in his life, his parents put him on a pedestal
Hes got a top five but no non-white rappers
Hes got a tattoo right above his champ stamp that says #Alllivesmatter
He loves chai tea, tai chi
He hates Spike Lee, doing The Right Thing
He loves Skyping, typing, hiking, biking
The word "Reiching", evidence hiding, stereotyping, racial profiling
Pretty much any white thing

Homie...you aint anything like me
You aint prepped for survival
Cause a year from now, nobodys gonna remember when you went viral
You may have cheated death before with Illmac but now your destination is final
We can all judge this book by this cover cause the story ends with the title

Thats one BITCH!

Roney Bae the King, formerly the prince
I call him "Cocker Spaniel" cause hes always been my bitch

Oh, so youre the super villain career ender
Well I dig that
I heard you even ended a marriage before, well thats a sick stat
But my rhymes change lives too, you doubt my impact?
Have you seen Big T lately? Hes 170 with a six pack

World Domination
What? I gotta break him down geographically?
I mean Taiwan fucks with me
I guess I got that Taipei (type A) personality
I mean chickas want my Calvins off
No strap to get my style across
Cause I rap like I got an Eagle thats the size of an albatross

I was whipping the drop Regal thats blacker than Don Cheadle
Youre pall (Paul) bearer, the jaw (John) ring gon (Ring) say "shells these are not Beatles"
Do you like your pops leave you
Horror script and the plots evil
And I already killed you once, my stories dont got sequels

Ill run up on him like the Rocky steps
Slash him with a hockey stick
I killed him once, I gotta kill him again like hes a zombie flick

But theres no skeletons in my closet so this aint another body
Youre only as good as the dirt you have and you have nothing on me
I mean, I didnt cheat on my girl, not a whore in my house
But not because I have morals let me just dispel that lie now
And not because of love, let me shoot that right down
I didnt cheat cause I was scared fucking Caustic would find out

Fucking Sherlock Holmes

He bides his time, thinking hes kinda sly
Stealing receipts, checking what I would buy like some kind of private eye
But I got hip to the game quicker, were not painting the same picture
Kay wigger? Theres a difference between a dirt digger and a grave digger

See, youre finished

Well...done stick a fork him
The mortician the 28.4 liter Ford engine
The unicorn Im Porzingis in the form with it
Im Ben Simmons on the floor spinning
A centaur while hes formed shifting but Caustic is just
Light and projection, its pure physics

You had the same hair/beard combo as every pussy at Coachella
So you can not be hard, its a simple little fact
Plus you have the same voice as the pig from Toy Story
So its only right I dump that nickle in his back!

Yo, Ill hit your niece with the braces
Get her tea bagged til her teeth snag, Im her new dentist

You fuck with [?] I use her team flag as a skeet rag
Ill let the team shag
I could get half of your family tree bag
Your baby mom is 43, does speed and lets her jeans sag

Your baby mom looks like a drag queen, Ill get your queen dragged
Rip his beard off, do his Adams apple like a speed bag
I dont care if Souls punch was softer than a fucking bean bag
You got slapped and just stood there just like that shit was freeze tag

I mean, daaaaamn Daniel
I bet that pussy wet as dam Daniel
That pussy got man handled
He hit it then kick it out he told to go pan handle
Watch me grand stand you
Van Damme you
Damn Daniel you dont understand Im snuffing your mans candle

Watch me back stab you, over and over again like the needle gone on a back tattoo
Check, check, Martin Havlat you
Fold him, zip him, knapsack you
Style on him, Rat Pack you
Whip my phone out, fucking battle and beat him then fucking Snapchat you

But wait, wait, wait, wait

Maybe, keeping it all rappity rap is keeping it too basic
So if I acted how you act, well how would you take it?
Cause if I was you, I would probably name your girl and call her "a hot mess"
If I was you, I would take your statements out of context
If I was you, Id go low and come at your pops next
If I was you, Id probably blame you for Cadalack Rons death
I mean, getting high, getting high-


Listen to me Caustic! Listen to me Caustic!
Getting high in front of a recovery addict, why would he need that?
I cant believe that
So if I was you, I would probably blame you for his relapse

But Im not you

Im not you
I just know my friend would like to hear his name dropped
And I miss him
You miss him too?
Well Ima put you in the same spot
Rest in peace, thats one

Ooooh, hes gonna get personal with me, Oh gee golly wiz I cant wait
Why dont you go drink some fucking bleach since you think being whites that great
You used to be my right hand man, now you dont deserve my handshake
Game Of Thrones shit, still the King Slayer even though my right hand fake

I said I wish a motherfucker would, I be chopping em down
Blocks will come out, I be making Mr. Booblaka Chilaka Boo sounds
When it comes to rapping bitch Ive been snapping longer than locker room towels
Ill have you stretched on a table with the doctors around
Just to tell you you ass out like a hospital gown

Oh...so I was walking around thinking like, "Dude
What would make Adam just madder than hell?
What would take all the wind outta his sails."
Then he said, "Well we should mention our girls names."
Well, dont you date that bitch Allison Dale?
Yeah? Why dont you pass the message to that slut and tell her I can excel in every way that Adam has failed
If you look at her pictures, her eyes are sad you can tell
Shes so used to having two hands grabbing her tail
And get her asshole impaled by more African males than a crack addict in jail

And thats hard...

You know, thats a hard thing to live up to
But he makes up for it with a strong back rub and a solid "I love you."
He be kissing that bitch on the mouth like its the love of his life
But deep down he knows he just aint fucking her right
Shes got the Black Snake Moan she likes a little mud in her pipes

I dont even know why she fucks this guy
Hes all types of bitch, hes got red lips and rosy cheeks
Who the fuck you supposed to be? Tyler Swift?
You fucking giant vagina lip

I dont get what part youre not understanding
I dont know any other man in the world that couldve called to have a mirror match with a tranny
I mean this is the difference between us
Yall looking at a glimpse of a genius
But with all these pussy ass feminine little physical features
We all agree, theres No Shame if you decide to get rid of your penis

Well hold on, I got a question
How come every time somebody mentions a time Rone got molested
His face immediately looks like he just got a Botox injection?
Now, its my chance to get him so, I better get him

I mean, fans love to tell you what you can and cant talk about but you know me, I never listen
They said "Its an automatic loss if you talk about Sandusky or any of his alleged victims."
Well as far as Im concerned if you getting defensive about getting molested then you probably got fucking molested with em

Now I know talking about Sandusky is played but yall know I got a little something to say
To be honest Adam, Ive uh...studied your case
And Im not saying that being molested makes somebody gay
But...you were on the track team
At any point did you consider just...running away?
Is that not something you would try?
I mean all those years of learning how to take a baton from behind
Its like you learned nothing from the guy

I mean maybe thats why your little album Committed was trash
You havent dealt with all that shit from your past
Maybe all those Sandusky dicks in your ass changed your pitch when you rap
All those sexual assaults and you never did nothing back?
You got raped by your running coach no wonder you sound like such a bitch on your tracks

See I like saying shit like that just to watch him get rattled
But if you wanna see some really weird shit, why dont you check out his Complement Battle
Now, the second I turned it on I knew there was something fucking strange going down out here
But it did answer a long time question
Whos dick do you gotta suck to get a title shot around here?

And then you think and its just you know, its just Adam and Patrick
Theyre always coming up with the wackiest antics
You know, running around Canada, acting like faggots

But thats the part that makes me think somebody really raped you
Maybe you overplayed the gay thing to cover up how uncomfortable it actually makes you
So while you were out there pretending to be a couple gay dudes
How about the fact that for all that gay shit you did, Pat never actually paid you

Awww, this shit just got incredibly real

Aye, he done sucked a dudes dick and didnt even keep up his end of the deal
Adam calling every day and Pats like, "Dont worry Adam you getting it still."
And then you took him out to dinner in L.A. and you got fucking left with the bill

Thats amazing, my dude Pat, screwed you for two wacks
And you didnt do shit bitch, what part of Philly did they do that?
I mean and I dont blame him, look at Pat, hed fucking whoop his ass

He wasnt trying to scuffle but he played it like it was an accident but you actually kind of got hustled
I bet you was having Sandusky flashbacks yelling at Pat like, "Why did I trust you?!"
It sucks Adam you just cant help but get fucked by the guys you look up to

I said you either real or you aint dawg, there aint no in-between
We aint cut from the same cloth, Im tailor made for the game or so it would seem
Cause when it comes to rhyming Im on top if you know what I mean
You a cup of noodle, Ill peel your lid back just to blow off some steam

Infrared beams look like techno lasers
Dealership maintenance you just met your maker
So nows a good time to go ahead and accept yo savior
Before I make the Devil your fucking next door neighbor
I said thats a sign youre a bitch, I aint here to impress no haters
I said the deuce deuce is a good buy/bye, I protect my paper
In a fair one, you wont fare well, I dont respect yo gangsta
Plus I got a piece so long itll catch you later

Bitch


Man, that fucking gangsta shit is the weirdest shit Ive heard about you
I talked to the rest of the white battle rappers and to be honest
The fellas are getting worried about you

Bro, its like you cant decide if youre Jamal or Geppetto
An Italian who acts black? Where you from? The Spaghetto?

Talking about this fake drug dealer shit
Selling, copping, never stopping
Bragging bout who he sold to, Benny, Robby, Jenny, Johnny
He even made a deal in a Dennys lobby with Hammurabi
Bro, you know who else sold weed before? Fucking everybody!

Bro, my little sister, sold packs of loud shit
You dont hear her bragging bout it
My grandmas stylist was packing ounces
Shit, so was my dads accountant

If you do all this secret illegal shit then why would you tell us?
Hes like, "Gangsters move in silence
And did I mention I sell drugs?"

Well, I [?] whatever drugs you got
Im talking crack, pills, heroin
Even if its legal drugs, Im talking Advil, Claritin
Ill throw your bitch off the roof like Im Dan Bilzerian
Ill throw your shoes on the phone line while your mans still wearing em

You wife her, Ill snipe her like click click boom, La Di Da Di
She on the patch then Im Slick Rick smooth
Ill send a photo of the bands then send a dick pick through
Thats the chicken and the beef like a McPick 2

But I got a top five reasons you should not rap

Number 1: you are a cable guy for Comcast
You know what? Fuck the list, we can stop flat
Reasons one through five, they are all that

Fucking cable guys deserve a special section of Hell
Where the Devil tortures them sometime between 7:00 and 12:00
Fucking Ferry the Cable Guy, our second battle isnt stressing me
But I feel like Matthew Broderick cause the Cable Guy is obsessed with me

So this for every time you said 5:00 and showed up after 6:00
This is for every strangers toilet that you clogged with a massive shit
This is for every shitty operator yall have ever had talk to me
Every one of them in India who claims their down the block from me

Fucking cable companies are an inherently un-American symbol
Comcast runs a Monopoly and you just play the thimble

So I want remunerations for dealing with your faggot shit
So after I beat you, youre hooking me up with all of the sports packages
You know what? Fuck all the sports packages
I dont want sports packages let me be more accurate
I want the porn packages
Fucking Skinamax? Gimmie that
Bunny Ranch? I fucks with that

Hes already asked but heres something you should know about me now
If I cant have battle rap I will burn it to the ground
I mean, Dizasters been ducking me like Im not in that class
Dizasters been ducking me like some kind of Math class
I heard Tay Roc run his mouth, how is he a threat?
Bro, I would take care of Roc/rock like a Chia Pet
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a PG vet
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a vet PG
I whip Roc/rock like Nash when hes MVP
I would get rid of rock like an NBD
Ill 30 Rock/Roc like the studios at NBC

And yall might think Im losing focus, but maybe you should know this
Before the battle I Instagramd evidence that he doesnt write his own shit
So log onto @adamferrone to read every word now
Or just wait cause well get into it in that third round

Yo, you mentioned my homie Ron...I swear to God Im a writer
Bitch I could check this dick and feel nothing, Im like Bonnie Godiva

They said, "Caustic, did you see Day 1? Cane was snapping."
I was like, "Yeah, yes. But all his good lines were about me so I guess he still needs Caustic bars to get a major reaction."
I said, oh you didnt buy nothing right, Cane?
What the fuck were you paying for when you made the transaction?
You know what? You can just walk around with this L but I guess Stranger Things have happened

I said my dude came
It was three years I was hoping that youd change
But youre still the same bum begging for bars with loose change
I said you still got your mouth wrapped around another dudes name
Youre like a shamed Olympian blaming the steroids for the poor decisions that you made

I said, Al can fucking blow me
At this point Al owes me some alimony
Acting like I snitched on somebody, no I just alerted my actual homie
About some fucking stranger who didnt pay me the fucking full amount that he owes me

But Im no angel though
Weve all gotten a couple bars along the way, you know?
But shit if we wanna talk about the ratio
I dont need a bunch of Facebook conversations posted to tell you what I gave to Rone

Oh...did you forgot?
When we were out there in England?
Dont Flop for the weekend
You couldnt finish your rounds cause you was too busy drinking
I gave you a whole round for Youthoracle right in front of you without even blinking
Youre like, "Hey, thanks Caustic Im sorry I choked. But you dont write how I be normally speaking
But hey itd be cool if we could keep this our little secret."

Awww, you little fucking faggot dude
Aye, you mad at me?
What about a week before your battle with T
And didnt have much help to give you but I did give you a little something didnt I you manatee

[Rone]

Never

[Caustic]

Never?
I mean imagine me
Bunch of people get credit for my writtens
But I can tell you like this, Ive taken a lot less than Ive given
So whoevers feeding you your information is telling you some fucking fiction
And besides, Erik Foreman helped you write this whole fucking battle so whats the fucking difference?!

No?

See, if you look at his name itll prove that hes a hypocrite in the long run
Cause he likes to sit around and call people frauds even though you are/R one
I said I know who I am, these battlers should have a natural fear
But this is your second title match
Ive had bars in title matches for the last three and half years
And if youre confused, you think that shit is weird
And you dont think that shit is actually true
Then why arent you taking a second and ask half of the fucking battlers in this room

But its Rone!

Its Rone who theyve given me
He composes it like a symphony
Hes simply, says simple things a bunch of filler schemes and similes
But he hides it behind this whiny high pitched delivery
So you cant tell hes the least quotable rapper in King Of The Dot history

I mean every since you became a little mini-celebrity
You think you got all the answers like that guinea from Jeopardy
Im sick of this fucking rich dickhead kid disrespecting me
The only privileged I ever had in my life was a fifth of Hennessy
And after I finish that Im gonna find your little sister Stephanie
And dig her the fuck out like a hysterectomy
See him and Erik Foreman have been on the internet instant messaging
Desperately trying to discredit me
To make me lose I swear to God theyll do anything

But, Ive got enemies
Got a lot of enemies but both you faggots bout to get the same vasectomy

But since youre a man of education lets look at it scientifically
You lost momentum while I gave it a simple transfer of energy
Cause if you break it down to the chemistry
Your volume to the masses doesnt have any density
Cause even in the most basic of matters
You just cant trust Adam/atom cause they make up everything

[Rone]

Youre a liar bro. Youre a liar

[Caustic]

Im a liar? Im a liar?
Thats your observation?
The best you got is a 2012 Photoshop conversation?
Suck a fucking dick?
That shit is fucking finished
Youre supposed to be a fucking champion, now you out here coming with gimmicks

Dude that shit is fucking actually true
If you were a real fucking champion you wouldve showed up to the event and interacted with fans like champions do
Your trend ended before you started youre the Ed Hardy of battling dude

Dude, I was gonna retire after I won this shit

Thats some shit I thought I never would say
I was just gonna take the chain and left yall for dead
Then I thought about it, is that really how this legend will end?
Then I said, "Fuck it"
Id rather stay and break Pats record instead!

Lets go!

So this is not a regular battle round
You know, a verse on his weaknesses
So fuck a crowd, fuck a crown, these are personal grievances

So lets not mince words
You missed your first battle with Big T cause you were hung over from some bad coke
On Friday youre doing great, the next day you cant go
Once the fans had their money paid and thats why youre fucking fake
Cause you were in Chicago at the venue but couldnt go because a tummy ache?
Bro, what the F is that?
How is he your expecting champ when he might miss any heavy scratch from a bout of the menstrual cramps
Fuck losing any respect, mine for dude didnt exist
Cause I did the same drugs and was fine, your immune systems a bitch

But the very worst thing from the scene from that night
Worse than Mr. Free Drugs being a fiend for that white
Is your slogan, "Free Drugs" I was believing the hype
And then I watched you pay for those shitty drugs at a fucking premium price
I mean, what happened to the slogan dawg? I really believed that
When I say "Grandmoms favorite grandson" ask my grandmom I really mean that

But yo, theres something bigger about your fame that has driven me insane
How you made your whole name off of ghostwriting for Arcane
But behind the scenes us battlers know you in a different way
You are the most notorious recipient of shared bars in the game

Oh yall want names?
Yall want names?
Fresco never gave you bars?
Fredo never gave you bars?
Frank Stacks never gave you bars?
D-Lor never gave you bars?
Fucking Reverse Live never gave you bars?
Fucking Real Deal never gave you bars?
Bro, fucking Marvwon never gave you bars?
Madness never gave you bars?
Bro, and thats the ones I know, imagine ones I dont

Imagine all his secrets if thats the stuff he shows
I mean the first time he called me for bars we werent even bros then
It was against fucking Roosevelt and that was back in 010

Its really just incredible what he does behind the scenes

{KOTD crowd member starts losing his fucking mind. Apparently shouting out at no one like hes on PCP or some shit}

I watched five battlers give him bars for Mr. 13
Vers Arsonal, Chedda Cheese, every battle its obscene
Last year vers Big T it was full four bar schemes
And you still skipped the battle after I directly gave you bars
So stop lying you are not genius that you claim you are

Battles on 24 hours notice really arent that exciting for him
When you realize he probably has like 24 writing for him
I mean, fucking getting bars, burning bridges, that just shows hes a selfish guy
His slogan "Free Drugs" that explains his healths decline
But after all his snitching it was on himself this time
Cause Mr. Free Drugs has always needed someone elses lines

And the way you vilified Arcane when you are ten times the cheater
Thats like getting ethic lessons from fucking Carlos Mencia
Go and get your ghostwriters I guarantee theyre not enough
Oh you write your own shit? Yeah so does Melania Trump

I said you really cant compare duke
I say shit theyre scared to
You dig dirt, find someone thats written for me, I fucking dare you!

Bro, this is for all that bad karma you built up
All that cattiness displayed
Because all of that bad karma that comes back to you TODAY

So I hope you get STDs to what you said to Q-Shinobi
Based on what you said to K, I hope you lose one of your closest homies
For what you said to Caddy I wish you dope scared veins
And your mom deserves to die for what you said about Arcane
Based on Soul, I hope your girl moves away, far from you
From Jeff, I hope she cheats, just to make it hard from you
From Ex-I I hope you know the guy
And just to make it horrible
I hope its one of your best friends from what you said to Arsonal
I hope they run a train on her from what you said to Cortez
I hope she gets a restraining order from what you said to Megadeath
Then I hope you get back together and the two of you have babies then I hope that fucking kids retarded from what you said to Matt Daley

Bro, you are a rat and a snake

Thats just how I see him
This is bigger than rap beefing, both coasts or regions
So Im not lobbying for a win and I dont care if you believe it
But any league where hes the champ isnt one I want to be in!

Lets go man, thats it

Apologies to all my fans who been expecting a hit.
I had some real life issues come up to be dealt with a bit,
then i dropped twenty pounds, to pretend I was sick,
asked for Mook, and hoped no one would remember this shit.

This gon be different, Flex. I hope you warned your team.
A sad look, and I put that on everything; thats the Jordan meme.
I came out west to say some shit thats sort of mean,
so you gon get killed at home by a dickhead, like that Clockwork Orange scene.

See, I already love this city. More than facts.
My bro Daylyt showed me all the best spots to get restraining orders at.

I said, “Its cool, you aint gon do me no harm.
A roid rage the only time youll see a mad flex shooting them arms.

But fuck the jokes. Just keep a distance when we rapping,
cause I paid some cholos off thatll split you into fractions.

Think ticket sales, cause if you fuck wit me, its a killing;
give me limited space, and you gon get a buck fifty in the building.

They like, “E, thats how you punchin? Its too soon.”
True. This shit I bottles ups a trip, like huffing on poop fumes,
plus a bar from MadFlex thats more than nice is sort of like an orange slice:
you getting it once in a Blue Moon.

I give a fuck what this douche bag fool packages.
Your crews faggots, a fruit salad; its too saddening,
and if your dudes acting true savages,
Ill Facebook spam you a few battles and
have you scared to remove tags like new mattresses.

Look, it dont matter if yall with the shit Flex brought.
As far as a Fresh Coast fit, youre equivalent to wet socks.
You probably spent this week sitting at your desktop,
trying to get hype while giving yourself pep talks and listening to Plex Rock .
Meanwhile, I been whipping up a fresh pot.
The way Ill son yous different; I aint kidding, Im your step-pops.
Like midgets serving top shelf liquor how youll get stopped,
cause the bars been set so high that you cant even hit me with your best shot.

So, I dont want to hear no shit that end with “Eas(z)y, E”.
You got to go crazy; thinking out your right minds your only chance of seeing me.

And yo, that shit was fucking nice.
Im breaking down your thought process,
cause the right side of your brains what makes a vision come to life.

And you could Ask Jeeves if you aint ever known,
the shit I bring smarter. King Arthur: if you got a point to set in stone,

get taken out. Im nicer wit the quotes.
It aint an issue to get Mad shelved when everything hes writing is a joke.

I couldve said “magazines”, like clips that jam,
since Im known to pop punks but got a Simple Plan
to have you looking stupid over nothing(nutting) quicker than a minute man.
You just gon stand there and give me the win, cause you my biggest fan.

Yo, round one, we aint gotta discuss it.
I swear that was my lightest shit. Well, actually, it probably wasnt.

Shouts to the vets ducking that battle with Flex.
Real Deal said financially it has to make sense,
but he might shut that shit down in your class if youre ten.
I know, you making big moves, Trevor; we wont ask you again.
Hey, fuck him. I picked a writer that I had to respect
and brought him out to the West. Thats not true. I have to confess:
I came to see if a virgin could have a dad bod, and the answer is yes.
The man aint a threat.

Like Id have a hot battle
with a dude whod eat a condom full of heroin, and then not travel.

Look at you. You still booking through false bravado,
and I wasnt askin Avo to talk to Hollow,
but every time I hit up Gs it was  followed by silence; it was not staccato.
They dont get it. Weak today, hot tomorrow.
Most of what I spit go over heads: Im Triple H with that water bottle,

so try to follow. But we building a classic,
like.. Nah, fuck that, you sound better when you absent.
Get cracked and do the math, then flush it down the toilet,
its no portable TheSaurus girl: I came to put this whole card on the canvas.
Boy, you bout to get your ass kicked. Get ravaged; one jab clip
turn him around quicker than walkin by a bad chick.

You dont have shit. Nah, Fuck You; you see low green(Cee-Lo Green).
Hell catch the first 48 from my last three 16s.
Add it up. You wack as fuck.
You need to give me more space than some JNCO jeans.

You aint been killing shit like Ive been.
Womens bathroom: go ahead and freshen up, fuck how hot the line is.
Tread light, and get a grip though; you been out of alignment.
I follow E.F with that G check, I aint alphabetizing.

This is second nature.
You always got some mark down watch like a jealous neighbor,
but the cliche suits you: thats the yellow ranger.
Dont get in danger. Keep pitching these bitches that less is greater
and watch him hit the floor so many times, now you an asshole on an elevator.
…And I wrote that before Money Bagz; he no showed. To hell with haters.
I still miss Caddy. Show up like Will Smith cabbie:
Eyeball that Fresh plate, everyone in yo home smell you later.

Im nice.
Thank you. I need that rack, cause, thats your cue to break out,
cause you aint solid enough for stripes.

Fuck your life. I struck the light under the butane for him.
Veruca Salt round: dude can fall down with these goose eggs on him.
You aint near my level; pipe down, but you aint warpin.
No arrogant talk back, from the best Eric in Talkback..
Ah, Farrell(feral). Thats a starved cat. Man, you aint Foreman!
If these words hit a nerve, it aint a toothache forming.
This is not a drill. Lets get back to the root. Wait for it.
Dolla dolla bill: Im back building with my face forward,
cause a dollar bill got a building on the back and a face forward.
You like that?
The lesson of the day going, dont show up to the game if you aint scoring.
Man, I keep hearing E pushing keys. I mean, maybe, do you play organ?
Like, what, you got “haymakers for neighsayers”? If you train horses,
you pay for it, I corpse him with a Liu Kang horsekick.
Fuck around and it wont matter if the shoe game horrid.
I boot his lip, the 12 wings turn to the Flu Game Jordans.

What up, Spice Rack? Nah, me and you, the pay grade aint the same rate.
Book club: I just got to make sure we on the same page,
cause all your punches hit, but they whip before they nae nae.
Start buttin in, I could start button him, and save this played game.
Believe me, uh(bulimia), I put a lot of time into this straight waste.
I didnt want to work this out in my house,
but Id look so fucked up if I skipped you; this is Leg Day.
Good luck man, dont get your shit kicked off of the main page.

I took this matchup cause you got a fire pen.
I mean, to me your writings number one, on a scale of fucking five to ten.
They say you like a white Passwurdz with the style, when
you more like an incorrect password; check your caps lock and try again.

Its tiring how you cramming your rhymes.
A flight delay when you write that way, cause shit aint landing on time.
We see you ramble on lines
and try n meet today(2-day)s standard with a rushed delivery like Amazon prime.

I know your flows the core of how you open doors,
but when these leagues got feeling you under pressure,
kinda like the ocean floor,
you need to punch with conviction, focus more,
cause when you choose to speak its a nudist beach:
you nowhere(no wear) close to sure(shore).

You aint suited up to play here. Im better.
Plus, you did your last three matchups in this format, and that aint very clever.
You should learn to change gears whenever,
cause the point of going Back to Basics isnt just to fucking stay here forever.

Thats why you should shut your mouth.
I got a punch for every Cali match you had no one gave a fuck about.

So those that ducked you probably got a point.
Why test Flex(-)ability in this(dis-)location,
when he proved that he cant get it popping in the joint?

And I hope you thought that shit was soft.
I wrote a flex ability bar just cause I know how much they piss you off.

See, disrespects what Im bout.
I once battled Cortez and choked the whole time,
just so the footage wouldnt ever come out.

Im different. See, Flex cool, but I was best left off alone,
and since this corn rose(rows) to the occasion,
if he get it twisted here(hair), Ill knot his dome.
Ill tell him, “Watch how u talking, homes,”
cause dogll get a two-piece in his mouth
like the sunscreen bottle if he cop a tone(Coppertone).

Lifes a beach; Ill catch you trying to kick up your feet in sand,
and pull up in the Jeep wit some big shit to sweep the land.
Even if you bring the pigs, Ima get to meet(meat) with cans, like eating spam,
sock a(soccer) bitch and let it kick over green; thats Mia Hamm.
I know because we seasoned fans, it seems we fam.
Ill tell you that I need a hand, then have you flying from a hook; you Peter Pan.
We should at least had planned to put up each a grand,
cause I aint got to post my Dont Flop battles in Talkback to see a band(banned).

At this point, killing all yall is too necessary.
Facts(fax). Im getting paper for the principle(principal): school secretary.

Charge a rack for a mixtape feature.
You should probably take notes from the kid like a fifth grade teacher.

Anyone who think Im Stephen Curry getting thirtyd by Flex
is talking crazy out the ass: Eddie Murphy in Shrek.

Round two, I aint came for classic.
I put Brian in a box,
like a guy whose name was Brian died and eventually was placed in a casket.

Putting this cub scout on the thug route, was whose decision?
Was it you? Come get him. Ill wait, Im used to chillin,
like... Any bark, n E. (N.E.) heart break, thats New Edition.
Your moms mastered the science of fucked up genes(jeans): thats True Religion.
Schemes: but I dont buy it, he lose commission.
Get through the mission.
I know Bad Dudes; you know Shaq Fu. We moving different.
Tell Avo this shit is Roscoes; Im through with chicken.
He spent his life as a proven victim, yall knew the symptoms,
and yall react to his fake ass punches? Fuck yall. Two for flinching.
Im too efficient.
Look, do I choke? No. You get bars til you stop: I use submissions.
I got goons to kick in
and, pop, put money under a pillow, youd think a tooth is missing.
Boom, hit him. Mix the jab-cross with the shoe position
til that hook follow a tackle, and I aint tuna fishing.
Id supply some good advice if you would listen.
They just got to add a little paper to cook E(cookie); thats Confucianism.
At this point, Im just fooling with him.
Call up Dot and let that "um Berretta" open up in his house,
like, "we aint worried bout superstition."
Eric, I fuck with you… Youtube ll get it.
I fuck with you, but you a mild substitute, a euphemism.
I got charm n(Charmin) wipe my ass with fabrications you have written.

Truth to fiction: Spice Rack, go hold down the herbs,
but Im known round the world,
and you known cause Bangz louder than a comb down with a curl.
He say he pop Molly?  He will throw down with a girl,
and you can pick up the pieces.
Tell this chump I want some background funk: we playing Toejam and Earl.

Look at me, dork.
The hands come out for a broken man down, it aint the peace corps.
You leave, or get hammered in a trunk, now you a tree fort.
What the fuck you want it with me for,
when you looking as uncomfortable as you without a keyboard,
and hella squares on his side like Nike Elite shorts?

I got messages for squares, so, grab a Post-it.
Its just a little light when you snap; thats a glow stick.
Who you roll with?

What? Yall break my shell for the cream like crab chowder?
That coward couldnt break news if he was Matt Lauer.
Flex: rap game Jack Bauer.
No Chilla Jones shit, like "tear a wrist when Mad counters”,
it just takes a week to learn what Ive done in the past hour.
Keep the soda. Teach him yoga; dog posing flat downward.
Youd get caught if you got into dirt, thats warning track power.

Relax. There aint no reason to score this match.
Just upload the shit to YouTube with a corpse attached,

Im so beyond. I mean, you know me. Obi Wan, cause I can force the hand.
Im through with this moving through duplicates, cause this aint Orphan Black,
and I aint holding back without a torture rack.
A single punch ravage through his body and transform a cat,
and Ravage a Transformer cat, so when I say transformer: facts.
But if i spoke like you, its "fayacts".
But when I say transformer, facts,
cause first it meets the eye, then you get more than that.

Motherfucker, now you die, and Id bet one or two lives
that you ride with a bank account balance that fucking matches your shoe size.
In summary, Eric, your mama shouldve got her tubes tied.
Fuck you, guy.

I got a story that might just make your day. (It might not, either.)
One time I faced a j, then hit the club to sip some Tanqueray.
I threw my balls at your bae(bay) like the As came to play.
She didnt didnt shut my game down; just covered all bases; thats a rain delay.

Translation, homie: I got drunk as shit and fucked your bitch.
Im kidding; I just got drunk as shit and let her suck my dick.

She even topped the whole squad off cause she likes the whips we drive.
Before she left, everyone was blew(Blue): Eifell 65.

Fuck your life. Thats some shit Im hating on,
cause to me, son aint really that bright, out here trying to break a don(of dawn).
Its like as a baby, you was dropped by your crazy mom,
and your head had taken more hits than my favorite bong.

But you dont smoke pot. That got me really surprised;
this whole venues stoned, bro, even the ceiling is high.

Real rap, I bet youre prolly mad at weed,
and think that being a pothead
will surround you with more fruits than fucking Johnny Appleseed.

See, getting fucked ups just something Flex dont need to write raps.
Pull a  joint out, he gon look at you like Jesus Christs back.
Go to spark it, hes like, "please dont light that,”
then he just might snap and kill the buzz like a Venus flytrap.

But try that here, I aint gon be the one thats laughing;
out of nowhere, Ima get it shaking with Flex: muscle spasm.

If I throw a left fist or right at homes, his nose ll break.
Then he gon feel right at home with a red bridge like the Golden Gate.

Yeah. Fuck stretching em wit a Ruger.
Ima take you to school, and then teach you a lesson like Im your tutor,
like how Avocado booked this and CTs 3 hours ahead:
Ill be talking to a vegetable in the future.

Yeah, so you gon lay with your frame broke.
I got a gun that spit so crazy, shit came with a raincoat,
and when I pop it at your face and your brain smoke,
your third eye could open up, but you aint gonna stay woke.

I aint trying to have Flex offended, just flex my pen,
cause I got less than 10 bars til we back to being friends again.

Its just sad I had to fuck up your movement.
Never shouldve got Mad in the first place, like I jumped to conclusions.

They say my drive been watered down; thats a car pool.
But I think I still spit solid; thats hard drool.
If they said you heating up, its just cause you arent cool.
Plus, all your punchlines are shit: you have bar stools. (Boo.)

I got bigger fish to fry, and Brian aint an obstacle.
Now I got to stick with jokes like I ate a popsicle.
Plus, that MadFlex name is comical,
cause you getting straight bodied, while Im bending over backwards
just to make it possible.

I said I cared about this, I probably lied.
I just wanted free tickets to see Carter Deems live.

And thats still on the bucket list.
Thats all for now folks. If MadFlex aint at World Dom Ill be fucking pissed.

(I dont want to be mean to you for another round, Eric. Its gonna go bad.)
You came out here looking like the product of some one night stand with Absyrd-
(No, you dont understand, it gets worse.)
You came out here looking like the product of some one night stand with Absyrd
did the fucking fusion dance with a Amber Alert.

That still aint better than a no show.
I start attacking E til plasma streaming from his head; wanna Go Pro,
then you curl up, and I leave on a high note like Soul Glo.

Frodo, this charity. I mean, it may be deductible.
These motherfuckers paid you in Lunchables.
Dont talk about money. If he do, dont trust this fool.
Lactose intolerance, cause you just got a little cream,
and it makes me uncomfortable.

Bump knuckles, wed catch a case like fuckin bellboys.
If you flex an arm connect, it is a frontal deltoid.
You got more goons in JeFFs Mustang than the one that fell Troy?
Cool. The whip next to the ratchet, shit, Im Uncle Elroy.

You hear that? Get used to those.
It just happens when a true man show versus the Truman show.
Heres some shit that some of yall hoopers know.
He missed his shot, but he goes down no matter how you spin it.
Whats that?  Shooters roll.
You a troll. You got "da feet" bars. Id never use one though,
cause I dont fuck around with da feet, boy, Im in cruise control.
The usual. The 50 Super Bowl dumped roman numerals,

A.K.A. Take this L, you played yourself.
Its "lets work" til the network make a joke disappear;
this one here Dave Chappelle.

Well, you a little more Velma, Shaggy, Brennan Dassey.
Im an athlete,
and Clark Kent came out the booth like, "I thought I was half geek".
Half the room knows, Dan Larusso with the bad knee
is the only time in his life that hes seen somebody clap heat.
Now, I cant tell if you animated or anime, kid; your style is mad cheeks.
20 battles, I still aint heard you to rap, E.
Get the picture; I tag E. Collapsing back teeth all hit the damn street.
He pick it up, pick it up, pick it up; thats Black Sheep.
Im nasty. Fix the crib for your girl like Nick and Gatsby,
then your Boo aint never leaving the house; its Mr. Radley.

High school education bars.
You aint a star, Farrell. Fuck rap. Your whole stack fit into a mason jar.
I lay a beat down until E sound like bass guitar.
You a shooter? No. You get Happy to play for par,
and you pay a goon or two to root for you cause you cant raise the bar.

Jackass. Nah, the care package void.
Get drilled for real, a southpaw to scare Pastor Troy.
You lack the poise.

I mean, you something that these squares can enjoy,
but you fronting in the hood so hard the airbag deploy.

You terrible. I throw my fist in just to fish from the bottom barrel?
This bull come to a close(clothes) like the Rocks apparel.
I am not comparable.
You keep ignoring the cost. You Horrible. Boss,
Ill kill him, why you callin(Colin) Farrell?

This a waste of movement,
cause you mixing in more fake drums than eighties music,
and I start to feel a hatred brewing.
I mean, its Eas(z)y, E, and for the Record, it may be Ruthless.
But you not my cup of tea cause the tables turned: thats a lazy Susan.
I hate these new kids.
They aint proven, and they aint seen shooting.
I got a gun in the safe with the safety safely rooted
and I did not bring the shit, I aint gon use it.

Look at him. You dont let the tech blast. I dont stress that.
True to form, Human Torch:
you (poof) hold your fire when you get mad. You get that?

Nah, Flex- that jabroni is Dellavedova to Kobe,
puttin Goldberg the wrestler vers Goldberg the goalie.
Dethrone me? Hoe, please. Your whole steez is dopefiend.
Im so deep in the game even the old me was an O.G.
White man flash (slap), red hand, dont crosswalk no streets.
Me and E trade, my stock too high; those seats come with nosebleeds.
Im testing switchblades on resting bitch face. You the homie.
You the first person Ill tell when I tell em that I got 0-3ed.
Eric I got 0-3ed.
Organik, if Im not on World Dom than you can blow..
your money, elsewhere, its your loss, O.

But this first isnt even the worst I promise that 3rd gonna get you/
So fall in line! And Ima tell him GOD IS GOOD! All the TIME!

Yall probably going to say Im going to Hell after this.

But if yall know anything about Saint Mic biblically then you know at the least lyrically its kind of my job to beat the “Hell” out of him.

I mean you on “Fire” right now baby.

Even locally has the potential to sell out events; so to sell out he vents.

Cause whether the money fast or its moving slow even a tortoise know he gotta “Shell” out the rent so..

Why yall think Im out here battling this old, Grinch that stole Christianity in the face looking as bitch. “youre a mean one”

Charging all these people to come out here and watch you pre judge they brethren all while you praise the Heavens, but what the Hell happened to you upper lip?

I know we aint discussing dogs in heat but aint “thiiiiis bout a fucking bitch”?

Only member of Beard Gang w no mustache cause every time he tried to grow one the hair just sliiiiid of yo fuckin shit.

Its Saint Mic vs the youngest Ned Flanders Oh, howdaly doodaly, Wow youre so new to me! Honestly I dont know what to say to you.

Old Bearenstein Bear cliff lip having ass look like your whole life consisted of playing flute. (whistle)

And your ancestors got me so conditioned to believe Jesus is White when I heard you bring Jesus to fights I aint know whether to come here and beat your ass to death or pray with you.

But since the goal of Christianity is to be Christ like I figured like Christ either was is cool; thats right guys he forgave you too, and you gone have to do a whole lot more than punch, scheme, and scream in Jesus name to make this debatable.

What if I told you God hated you?

And made you pay me to come here and Kill you as a way of proof; could you play it cool?

You know being denied entrance through the pearly gates of truth, after making all these people believe he favors you? And ironically the little angry black guy is the one who had a place for you?

You know if somebody asked me that I couldnt answer scrap just know this ass whipping gone feel the same…..Im pretty much describing the rest of your day for you.

You know how I know youre a gimmick?

Because you use religion as a common ground turn around, judge me on how I vent my evils.

You know how I know youre a gimmick?

Cause as a Christian you know damn well this aint the place where we supposed to portray were equals.

You know how I know youre a gimmick?

Fuck that I dont even need to just know I call my self Saint Mic because Im that good with one, thats just me fool.

Plus something like “Gods Wrath” is what he uses for those that He brew (Hebrew). I am lethal.

I am Only here to trim the fat thats what I must slim (Muslim) when I see food.

So while these Christians deny the Jew they is (Judaist) I promise after tonight he will not see (Nazi) his people.

Oh Jew (you) mad? Nah Jew Gassed, and guess who brought that Chamber to sleep you.

And tell your people, I suggest they move in silence; cause whoever boo this (Buddhist) can get the piece (peace) too.

Or need I remind you? You not my brother, or kin (Orkin) Man, see your religion work in sects (Work Insects) and we Protest Ants (Protestants) need I define you?

Cool cause I got more men (Mormon) to prove Karmas a bitch and in the end (Indian) Karma is right behind you (U). Oh what? I know it sounds like a reach, but it is true because if youre indian then Karma is right youd be Hindu;

What we doubt the bars? Only reason I was Tsu “surfing” the heavens in that last line was to prove it dont take a trophy rapper to reach out to God. Aaaaaah.

Yall must think to sock a God MC is not in me? Until the god in me and this boxer speed get him rocked to sleep when I see niggas. I get it “shaking” you fucking with the greatest so if he dont show where the Cash is (Cassius) in (Clay) is where I leave (Ali) niggas. End this Christian with the Ba! Ba! Like his first name Ali nigga!

Im a beast nigga, I eat niggas. Im a cannibal in sync with Animal instincts. I “Complex bars” to “break niggas” So you dealing with a Cannibal in sync with animal instincts and Im a Precinct. “Lights Out”.

Cause when IBattle I Bangz with the Can like “Get em a fucking Sod….Blaow! This dirty pop have em looking like he dancing with NSync Im nice.

God is Good….(Crowd: All the Time) So see what makes you think we need to have you here to remind us of what the Savior could? How about you remind everybody here that youre a part of the biggest Mob in the world and that Bible got more bodies on it than any dirty pistol in any one of my niggas neighborhoods.

You know what the crazy shit is? Last time I battled a white boy worth mentioning he practiced Atheism. I told him he was the same as Christians.

Another man corrupted by a butt fucking lame conviction, plagued with Pagan and plagiarism used to control and help him cope with the way he living. Say it isnt? Next round not only am I going to state specifics Im a make it vivid, go ahead with ya little criticism about my career and ya Saint flips nigga.

Can I switch it up a little this rd.? Yall cool with that? Good! Cuz in my preparation for Mic

That was pretty nice kid. But let me show you how to damage the nicest. Through channeling vices.

Most celebrated bible thumpers was later exposed as some sluts, like you about to be. Out here trying to get a good hold of some nuts and he aint clamping them vice-grips.

Dont look at me King. Cause look too long and get his “Royalty Check” Im strapped with the tools and no “mechanical license”.

You know I remember back when I first witnessed that one round extended match between you and some other senseless act. And you mentioned that you got into rap to talk to nonbelievers and bridge the gap.

And in the very instance you spit that rap I genuinely commended that, but something didnt match so I listened back something missing scrap… I mean outside the fact hes Christian, raps. At home and on sight (site) shout out ya Journalist for that. He believes in scripture, but puts his ten percentage in it as; Faith in God but not in man, who inspired by God wrote the book from where he gets it at so….Out side of a couple Christ flips and the aforementioned facts…..whats so Christ Like about what this nigga yaps?

Is it the Self Proclaimed righteousness via passive, aggressive, ambiguous attacks? Or the fact he has yet to mention any Devine message given, or expressed suggestion on how we should be giving back? See now I gotta ask where your intentions at?

And how do you plan or intend to bridge the gap between this and that? When its pretty specific that in this extent of rap the jist is that you go tit for tat. Wits get matched by way of some pretty judgmental and offensive raps to win the match; lift his stats, get some scratch. And by doing so, the losing opponents opportunities are actually slimmed in fact, so Im saying where exactly is Gods gift in that? Im not implying Im confident that its nonexistent, but if so how do you plan to implement it skrap?

I dont think you got the answers Sway. So allow an Emcee with no gimmick to kick the facts. All my real niggas know we vent the violence to prevent the violence and that right there is Gods gift to rap. So dont come up here, lying in whos name you preaching ya false teachings like you came here to heal the streets with that. We are positive and negative by Gods design, and even He know where Im from just venting, rather than doing the shit is about as positive as niggas gonna be with rap, so bitch keep ya act.

Its like yall gas his bars cause he told you he works on behalf of the staff of God. And yall just believed it. Well he doesnt have to cuss in his bars. Not afraid to say he fears God, hes not a fraud just flawless, a marketing genius. How? If I didnt know no better Id think you think he getting phone calls with some fucking exclusive offers from Jesus.  It aint Sunday. If yall need to know more of the bible nigga, yall should just read it!

That mutha fucka aint stashed in the Vatican or with Smack and them all vaulted and secret. He aint Cortez. Just another Christian with an agenda hidden for attention to his name through a mission that for Centuries already been force fed.

See what A Wards using is better known as Consumer relation. A little marketing tactic, publicly owned, were hell say yall his brothers and sisters but really view you as consumer related. So he sat back, studied, and consumed the relation; same way Christian Pilgrims that was cruising them Slave Ships () that moved to the States did. Seeking to start a new civilization, they claimed theyd teach a new “civil” way to elude and portray that they cool with its Natives. And look who doing the same shit! Using his faith as a tool of invasion, borrowing another groups innovations in hopes the consumer relates so he can consume what they making.

But like most I see the Greed in you. Yea you been impatient. So allow this surgery I give you be inpatient. And all you fake teachers, preachers, doctors, polices, all involved; if I gotta come back and slaughter hogs Im a get this whole strip baking (bacon). Mack a mockery of mine Ill come back and kidnap your first born daughter dog for having my identity a lil mistaken (miss taken) bitch. Aint no way he can say he killing me, for the rest of his life hell view this battle as a Slim Shady inury, and embrace (Em, brace) the shit!

I figure since we here, lets have some dialogue/
Right now, I want to talk with Saint, later well get the Mic involved…
You see that Word Saint, holds a dear meaning to me, because I walk in light/
I too am considered a Saint, but we dont walk alike/
The Greek word is Hagios (HA GE OSE), Morally blameless, physically pure, sacred/
But first lets bring that to context before we got into more layers/
There is none without Sin, Thats why Christ came and in light, Scripture
Depicts him as Jesus of Nazareth (a Jew), Im not sure who that dude is in the White pictures/
But Ride with me. . . His death and resurrection became the atonement for our lives/
Therefore through Grace by Faith; we have hope that is in God/
So as I servant we are covered, weve been washed from the stains right/
So were called Christians And that is the definition of a Saint, Mic../
Now correct me if I aint right, I feel you telling God “this aint my cup a tea”
When he lookin back like it couldve been this…. Saint Mic up a T…
Now I wont sit up here and say youre lost;  Cuz I dont know you from Adam/
But it does seem were cut from different fabric, so I should probably show you the patterns/
Ever FELT you were Caught in (COTTON) a mess lets say the Rents due/
Its a tough(FLEECE) lease, you and roommate dont MESH and youre spent too/
You sat an (SATIN) thought about it, cuz you owe a band and Plug is getting a cut/
So (SEW) what he needll (NEEDLE) put you in the read (THREAD), unless you get to stitchin him up/
Yall wasnt listenin up!
…. Cuz some of yall looking at me like son thats whack!
But I said we cut from different Fabrics so you gon think its fire when I … (run that back)

*Runs back with emphasis on scheme*

Lets get to stitching him up!
I said wed get around to Mic Right?/
Well Im old school like Yak Baks and a Lite Brite/
If I wanted I could put you in this knapsack Night Night!/
So thank God Im a changed Man!
Cuz Grace is that Gap between Michael and this Stray Hand/
I dont play fam…
Its not fair to rappers/
Another REASON, I see you base (CUBASE) your LOGIC off being a PRO with TOOLS
but I can tell youre soft where (Software) it matters/
Who engineered you? If something this Foul Can reach the Top – think Julio Stretching/
Its nothing to Hit him High – thats Coolio Message/
When a Wolf in ya face, - it aint Rubio Pressin!/
This for every time a Mic issue, messed up anybodys Studio Session/
Move to the side, cuz we on Next/
They overhyped you like you GoRilla cuz you Beat on Chess/
Im not convinced, Yall can hashtag Rise of the Saint!/
But right, now you lookin 5ft 5 in the Paint! – Lord stop him, Ford Shopping Go Find an Escape/
Lets get rid of him, Death Certificate, just sign and then date/
A different breed of Killer, Use kindness and faith/
This battle bro, Plaxico, your shots were a Giant Mistake/
Stop the Gun Talkin, you Sons watching…. He gon mime what you say/
Tell your 4th Grader you love him, thats how a real man looks a 9 in the face/
*Slogan*

Jesus Christ, ya boy just doesnt get it. Broke em down, two rounds, he still trying to punch his lil heart out.  Got the nerve to stand here all poised in his position.  We all seek gain in the name, but to convince his niche hell tell you its just poison that Im spittin.  And maybe you right. Through all the damage Ive provided, it does seem like Im glamourizing violence but this aint me glamourizing this me getting the poison out my system.

Gods gift to man was free will. You know, choices and decisions. So whats worse. Me up here hypothetically enforcing my existence or you forcing his conviction? I mean all the theatrics, running back to ya man dapping, fake laughing for consensus yet the hardest thing to do for you Christians, is listening!

Initially, I comprehended ya mission was to fill us with hope. Show us how to follow the will of the G.O.A.T., put down the pills and the dope, not criticize and try to kill us with quotes, or did you forget God will judge us both?  Look how many people came here for ya show, and judging by ya battle with FMag before you speak Gods will, you will judge an ear studded nose…. Well thats not Christian like…

But it is his type. Pathetic! The source of your hunger…synthetic. And even my stomach will tell you the real source for hunger is pain. You in this shit for your benefit not his ya bitch and the proof is all in this pigeons name. You want an Award?

Well you gone have to get it like Tyson nigga lets get loose. I mean you do have some “nasty stuff” in them “sucky rounds” to be “white, shit”…In other words Anubis was clit, and you tit juice; and I dont think you want me to squeeze to get proof.

Fuck a Flanders. You softer than some girl butt. Cant handle the bars get curled up, from these “ten speeds” leave em “rotten” for the “cabbage” turn Kimzy into Kimchee.

Greed, sloth, pride, wrath, gluttony, lust, envy; theres seven deadly sins and at the least bitch I am three. Till I Die im a keep it “100” Im man of the “Century”.

Look at his face. He gone try to say he isnt bothered. But he is. Starting to realize the difference between his creator and his father. You get to ask God “What?” I gotta ask him “Why?” We say two different prayers, we are two different problems!

This “Man” up to “Bat” and, you niggas “Gotham”. I do what I want here, who finna stop him. You? Nigga stop it.

Ah shit. Im bout to make it hard for the world to defy me why, because 95 percent of you battle rap niggas a bunch of “bitches slapping bitches” around….Why are you trying to be the next Heidi Fliess (female Pimp)? I dont know. But pussy nigga if I find out you out here pitching Christian, flipping bitches, or slicing pies; I will make sure every D Boy in ya crew will get murdered quick to put the “tools to your servers” Im the IT Guy!

Yea Im the IT factor. I kill a clown (Killer Clown) “Pump” to a “Writer” mouth. “Horror Fiction” aint ya job homie. You know the movie “It” factored in a Killer clown, and since he was in fear in the end I switched gears and came with “eight arms” on me. Saint Mic, Only angel that can blaze you niggas yea Im strapped with the Saviors Sinner the wrath of God on me!

KC. Cuz ya family? Understandably.  But since yall locked in “A Ward” perhaps I should free you of some of the Insanity, I mean. Come to these pussies. Regardless of what he believes you can believe we dumpin. Im a MidWest Dickhead Cunt how could you not “see me coming”?

I dont care if we moving its Christmas, we smoking, Leftovers, nigga you cant rap better than me in nothing!

You softer than ya baby pictures. Yall know Greek Mythology? Who gives a fuck! One to his “Cap” make em “invisible” Im a make it “hard to see the God” like he Hades nigga. My left, Wyclef have a wack spiritual rapper running for Haiti nigga. We thrive when its beef youll die in the streets I ride with a piece (peace) you couldnt see (C) my “Class” in a Mercedes nigga.

**Missing Bars**

I will kill any that fight foul with me, wild as me? How is he? You deliver it quite cowardly Ill hit you in yo chest so hard it change the logo from die daily to die hourly.

Heavenly Father (Prayer) I have not come to challenge you but more so the institutions that you bounded to. I was told to not “shoot” the “messenger” so I bring no disrespect to the Father. I just want him to “shoot” this “message” to SAGA.  (click) BLAKA!
