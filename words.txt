I'm the only rapper that these people really care for
You're the reason there's security in the airport
I'd tell you to suck my dick but that might be racist
Plus I don't want to get my shit caught in your braces
Maybe you deserve those, you're tiny as fuck
You get to stay up on your feet when a dude needs his dick sucked
I know I got a lot of faults, I'm aware of all that
But how you say you want beef when you allergic to that?
Fuck you, It's time to quit your bitchin'
Imma put this shit on Worldstar with the title "White Boy Kills Brown Midget"
(Worldstar nigga sleep!)
Fuckin up with that haircut, head shaped like Spongebob
You're trying to sell drugs like you think that's a fun job
Fuck that, and fuck you
When's the last time you heard your parents say "I love you"
How's it feel to know that I will always be above you
I ain't talkin height now, I'm talking on some other shit
Lyrics, Flow, Spiritual, I'm always on some other shit
You say you get ass, but you're hooking up with David's friends
After he is done with them and Baby J is sexting them
I could make a whole mixtape about you, that's some diss songs
My dude got suspended from his own prom
Cause he knew that he couldn't get a date to his own prom
But even David got one
How 'bout that
All these girls think you're cute
But not in a "date way"
More like an a "Oh, this little kid wants to play!" way
Well except for Mikayla, I heard you guys had a ball
But I was talking to Cristian, he said your penis was small

*beat drops*

You talk about ambition
Say you'll make a lot of money one day
Think the journey is all games and fun
But when it's all said and done
And I'm successful and won
You'll end up working at Tony's
With your little pink gun
Running errands for David
Not even making a fraction of what Arash does

You're up

You half a fool, you optimist
I see you like my optometrist
You talk about my girlfriend, but you ain't never really had one
Well Emma in the backseat, but you ain't never really had one
You say I'm fat and all, but thats because you're scared and small
You never had no self esteem, had to build a twitter regime
To get some good feedback, cause in real life, you ain't have that
I killed you in no time at all
Perfected rhymes and called you small
It took you twice the time as me to talk about some Adderall?
My response is half as long as yours, but this the most important verse
93, we with gardening tools
We all state, you ain't starting fools
Took a dream from in my head, groomed it, grew it, now here's The End
Kasey is my dawg and all
That's why he's KaseyBark, yanno
B Clark, Midgey, Durbsman, IceBox, Kimu, Labes, Billy
They been here since the start, but now it's winding down around the bend
Thank you all for listing, this is The motherfucking End

I hear you talkin' shit, bro you think you're the heat
Please bow down to defeat you're barely mince meat
Stop with the street talk, and start to do the street, walk
Lock yourself in and tell me this, how you gonna battle with this sick shit that I spit bitch
See you still flappin' your jaws, prepare to be thrown in the ocean
In the middle with jaws
Or prefer to be served and severed with claws, knock on the doors Of absolute death you may
But please be ready for the automatic failures you may make
So take this and wait for another dismembering, remembering
The tethering of your dream and how it was minced to pieces
Believe in yourself please, to save you now you'll be needin'
Help from Jesus
You think I'm copy, pastin' please, tell me how you're actin' up
Better be quite or I'ma bout to bitch smack your mouth shut
For good, yeah man talk the hood talk better go back and walk the hood walk you ain't had the taste of a real G
Get back down to your level and prepare to be beat
Writin' on your sheet, like you're deep please bitch your weak
You ain't on my level or a level at all, take a vacation
Up the damn wall and fall
Humpty Dumpty, I must be rusty but you better knock the shit Down if you goin' against me
I'm hard to beat, you're hardly cheese compared to these beats And this emcee
You ready, alright, so come on down, I bet you to do it
Let's see if you got the balls or if you're just truant
To me, yeah let's keep an eye, on your ass as the heat intensifies
Talk to me in a smart tone, prepare to meet your demise
Throw you, a hundred million miles is what I'm finna do
Call me Son Goku
I already told you, what I'm gonna do, finna plow through
Yeah man try to tackle a topic more intense then mine
I always rap from the heart, make the fake rappers sigh
But I really really don't give at all a flying fuck
My chance of making this shit is the same as seein' a flyin' truck
Or it could all depend on some serious luck
Maybe I'll release a track that is heard my millions
Make it big and to the top and make billions
But that's a dream for another day, I'm here to take you down
Don't care what you say
Freestylin' this rap shit to the grave
Rap battlin' bitches in my spare time for loose change
Please, all of you fake ass rappers are plan
Make like like a plane and take the next trip away
Far away, from here I don't need to here your shit anymore
I'm tired of it now, next place to be, will be a fuckin' morgue
But let me just let you all know this, I'm sick of it, all of it
So listen next time I write another track
Listen to the facts I spit, and find it through my old wack rap crap
I know I've said some shit, that know I demise
But just look at my own and, your own life
But this time, through my eyes
I got a couple little bitches that need a little call out
But I'll reside, got more and more, don't get me wrong
Now get the fuck back home and call your mom
Continue to rap please, just leave me alone
I'm done hearing wack disses like this
I'm sick of this, listening to this petty as shit
Bitch


I said what's up homie? Welcome to your own lobotomy
You may have sent Dirtbag Dan back to local comedy but ain't no one stopping me
We are World Domination 6, right? The whole globe is watching
Ain't that about a bitch? Like a Rone biography

I said my dude, I'm honestly happy for you
I thought you'd never be the champ son
Shit, we six bars into this title match
and it's already better than the last one

I mean I'm way too advanced son I can do shit that you've never did
That's why I gotta take his last breath before he get a second wind
I mean I heard you was gonna get personal with me, I must've got in his head
Y'all been begging for a king but instead you got a God in the flesh

You want your style...your style? Is as obvious as it gets
You rap like how bitches talk to their pets
Like, "Oh, you gon' rap like this is things you gotta handle
Oh. You gon' talk to Daniel like a Cocker Spaniel AARF!
Boy I catch you slipping on yo' campus while you flannel
Boy I gotta choppa knock you out your socks and sandals!"

This so don't panic, your punches do no damage
I'll [?] turn your nose into nothing but bone fragments
Body blows, give him a bleeding heart like a hopeless romantic
I'm nomadic, I leave Earth with no hope of going home to my own planet
You my bro Adam but that don't mean I won't got at him
Throw blows at him, bury him up to his throat and throw stones at him

You get cold feet? I toe tag you
You know that chrome Magnum
But that forehead cro magnum
My bullets hit you ricochet and hit Gully and Organik

I said they keep calling you a king but I think this king needs the boot
I mean honestly this whole chain needs a control+alt+delete and reboot
This guy called me a fucking "weed" man
But I think we can see the truth
I think he's just jealous of the weeds at least weeds has some roots

I mean my dude, you dressed up like fucking Abraham Lincoln trying to gain some views
And then you rapped about freeing slaves while all the black people tried to escape the room
The craziest shit is
Out of all the angles this lame could use
It's funny you dress like Abe Lincoln but you're the one getting the chain removed

I'm way too smooth, you ain't never been great
Let's face facts Adam I'm already a legend today
But I swear to God the only thing black in your house is electrical tape
He probably calls the cops on his own shadow like, "Stop him. He's getting away."

You're a fucking faggot with no stripes

You wanna gamble but no dice
This fool Adam is so white he won't even reach in his bars
He's had everything handed to him his whole life

I said, he'll out write me and then out white me
You don't want to mess with dude
He's never struggled a day in his life, his parents put him on a pedestal
He's got a top five but no non-white rappers
He's got a tattoo right above his champ stamp that says #Alllivesmatter
He loves chai tea, tai chi
He hates Spike Lee, doing The Right Thing
He loves Skyping, typing, hiking, biking
The word "Reiching", evidence hiding, stereotyping, racial profiling
Pretty much any white thing

Homie...you ain't anything like me
You ain't prepped for survival
Cause a year from now, nobody's gonna remember when you went viral
You may have cheated death before with Illmac' but now your destination is final
We can all judge this book by this cover cause the story ends with the title

That's one BITCH!

Roney Bae the King, formerly the prince
I call him "Cocker Spaniel" cause he's always been my bitch

Oh, so you're the super villain career ender
Well I dig that
I heard you even ended a marriage before, well that's a sick stat
But my rhymes change lives too, you doubt my impact?
Have you seen Big T lately? He's 170 with a six pack

World Domination
What? I gotta break him down geographically?
I mean Taiwan fucks with me
I guess I got that Taipei (type A) personality
I mean chickas want my Calvin's off
No strap to get my style across
Cause I rap like I got an Eagle that's the size of an albatross

I was whipping the drop Regal that's blacker than Don Cheadle
You're pall (Paul) bearer, the jaw (John) ring gon (Ring) say "shells these are not Beatles"
Do you like your pops leave you
Horror script and the plots evil
And I already killed you once, my stories don't got sequels

I'll run up on him like the Rocky steps
Slash him with a hockey stick
I killed him once, I gotta kill him again like he's a zombie flick

But there's no skeletons in my closet so this ain't another body
You're only as good as the dirt you have and you have nothing on me
I mean, I didn't cheat on my girl, not a whore in my house
But not because I have morals let me just dispel that lie now
And not because of love, let me shoot that right down
I didn't cheat cause I was scared fucking Caustic would find out

Fucking Sherlock Holmes

He bides his time, thinking he's kinda sly
Stealing receipts, checking what I would buy like some kind of private eye
But I got hip to the game quicker, we're not painting the same picture
'Kay wigger? There's a difference between a dirt digger and a grave digger

See, you're finished

Well...done stick a fork him
The mortician the 28.4 liter Ford engine
The unicorn I'm Porzingis in the form with it
I'm Ben Simmons on the floor spinning
A centaur while he's formed shifting but Caustic is just
Light and projection, it's pure physics

You had the same hair/beard combo as every pussy at Coachella
So you can not be hard, it's a simple little fact
Plus you have the same voice as the pig from Toy Story
So it's only right I dump that nickle in his back!

Yo, I'll hit your niece with the braces
Get her tea bagged til her teeth snag, I'm her new dentist

You fuck with [?] I use her team flag as a skeet rag
I'll let the team shag
I could get half of your family tree bag
Your baby mom is 43, does speed and let's her jeans sag

Your baby mom looks like a drag queen, I'll get your queen dragged
Rip his beard off, do his Adam's apple like a speed bag
I don't care if Soul's punch was softer than a fucking bean bag
You got slapped and just stood there just like that shit was freeze tag

I mean, daaaaamn Daniel
I bet that pussy wet as dam Daniel
That pussy got man handled
He hit it then kick it out he told to go pan handle
Watch me grand stand you
Van Damme you
Damn Daniel you don't understand I'm snuffing your man's candle

Watch me back stab you, over and over again like the needle gone on a back tattoo
Check, check, Martin Havlat you
Fold him, zip him, knapsack you
Style on him, Rat Pack you
Whip my phone out, fucking battle and beat him then fucking Snapchat you

But wait, wait, wait, wait

Maybe, keeping it all rappity rap is keeping it too basic
So if I acted how you act, well how would you take it?
Cause if I was you, I would probably name your girl and call her "a hot mess"
If I was you, I would take your statements out of context
If I was you, I'd go low and come at your pops next
If I was you, I'd probably blame you for Cadalack Ron's death
I mean, getting high, getting high-


Listen to me Caustic! Listen to me Caustic!
Getting high in front of a recovery addict, why would he need that?
I can't believe that
So if I was you, I would probably blame you for his relapse

But I'm not you

I'm not you
I just know my friend would like to hear his name dropped
And I miss him
You miss him too?
Well I'ma put you in the same spot
Rest in peace, that's one

Ooooh, he's gonna get personal with me, Oh gee golly wiz I can't wait
Why don't you go drink some fucking bleach since you think being white's that great
You used to be my right hand man, now you don't deserve my handshake
Game Of Thrones shit, still the King Slayer even though my right hand fake

I said I wish a motherfucker would, I be chopping 'em down
Blocks will come out, I be making Mr. Booblaka Chilaka Boo sounds
When it comes to rapping bitch I've been snapping longer than locker room towels
I'll have you stretched on a table with the doctors around
Just to tell you you ass out like a hospital gown

Oh...so I was walking around thinking like, "Dude
What would make Adam just madder than hell?
What would take all the wind outta his sails."
Then he said, "Well we should mention our girls names."
Well, don't you date that bitch Allison Dale?
Yeah? Why don't you pass the message to that slut and tell her I can excel in every way that Adam has failed
If you look at her pictures, her eyes are sad you can tell
She's so used to having two hands grabbing her tail
And get her asshole impaled by more African males than a crack addict in jail

And that's hard...

You know, that's a hard thing to live up to
But he makes up for it with a strong back rub and a solid "I love you."
He be kissing that bitch on the mouth like it's the love of his life
But deep down he knows he just ain't fucking her right
She's got the Black Snake Moan she likes a little mud in her pipes

I don't even know why she fucks this guy
He's all types of bitch, he's got red lips and rosy cheeks
Who the fuck you supposed to be? Tyler Swift?
You fucking giant vagina lip

I don't get what part you're not understanding
I don't know any other man in the world that could've called to have a mirror match with a tranny
I mean this is the difference between us
Y'all looking at a glimpse of a genius
But with all these pussy ass feminine little physical features
We all agree, there's No Shame if you decide to get rid of your penis

Well hold on, I got a question
How come every time somebody mentions a time Rone got molested
His face immediately looks like he just got a Botox injection?
Now, it's my chance to get him so, I better get him

I mean, fans love to tell you what you can and can't talk about but you know me, I never listen
They said "It's an automatic loss if you talk about Sandusky or any of his alleged victims."
Well as far as I'm concerned if you getting defensive about getting molested then you probably got fucking molested with 'em

Now I know talking about Sandusky is played but y'all know I got a little something to say
To be honest Adam, I've uh...studied your case
And I'm not saying that being molested makes somebody gay
But...you were on the track team
At any point did you consider just...running away?
Is that not something you would try?
I mean all those years of learning how to take a baton from behind
It's like you learned nothing from the guy

I mean maybe that's why your little album Committed was trash
You haven't dealt with all that shit from your past
Maybe all those Sandusky dicks in your ass changed your pitch when you rap
All those sexual assaults and you never did nothing back?
You got raped by your running coach no wonder you sound like such a bitch on your tracks

See I like saying shit like that just to watch him get rattled
But if you wanna see some really weird shit, why don't you check out his Complement Battle
Now, the second I turned it on I knew there was something fucking strange going down out here
But it did answer a long time question
Who's dick do you gotta suck to get a title shot around here?

And then you think and it's just you know, it's just Adam and Patrick
They're always coming up with the wackiest antics
You know, running around Canada, acting like faggots

But that's the part that makes me think somebody really raped you
Maybe you overplayed the gay thing to cover up how uncomfortable it actually makes you
So while you were out there pretending to be a couple gay dudes
How about the fact that for all that gay shit you did, Pat never actually paid you

Awww, this shit just got incredibly real

Aye, he done sucked a dude's dick and didn't even keep up his end of the deal
Adam calling every day and Pat's like, "Don't worry Adam you getting it still."
And then you took him out to dinner in L.A. and you got fucking left with the bill

That's amazing, my dude Pat, screwed you for two wacks
And you didn't do shit bitch, what part of Philly did they do that?
I mean and I don't blame him, look at Pat, he'd fucking whoop his ass

He wasn't trying to scuffle but he played it like it was an accident but you actually kind of got hustled
I bet you was having Sandusky flashbacks yelling at Pat like, "Why did I trust you?!"
It sucks Adam you just can't help but get fucked by the guys you look up to

I said you either real or you ain't dawg, there ain't no in-between
We ain't cut from the same cloth, I'm tailor made for the game or so it would seem
Cause when it comes to rhyming I'm on top if you know what I mean
You a cup of noodle, I'll peel your lid back just to blow off some steam

Infrared beams look like techno lasers
Dealership maintenance you just met your maker
So now's a good time to go ahead and accept yo' savior
Before I make the Devil your fucking next door neighbor
I said that's a sign you're a bitch, I ain't here to impress no haters
I said the deuce deuce is a good buy/bye, I protect my paper
In a fair one, you won't fare well, I don't respect yo' gangsta
Plus I got a piece so long it'll catch you later

Bitch


Man, that fucking gangsta shit is the weirdest shit I've heard about you
I talked to the rest of the white battle rappers and to be honest
The fellas are getting worried about you

Bro, it's like you can't decide if you're Jamal or Geppetto
An Italian who acts black? Where you from? The Spaghetto?

Talking about this fake drug dealer shit
Selling, copping, never stopping
Bragging 'bout who he sold to, Benny, Robby, Jenny, Johnny
He even made a deal in a Denny's lobby with Hammurabi
Bro, you know who else sold weed before? Fucking everybody!

Bro, my little sister, sold packs of loud shit
You don't hear her bragging 'bout it
My grandma's stylist was packing ounces
Shit, so was my dad's accountant

If you do all this secret illegal shit then why would you tell us?
He's like, "Gangsters move in silence
And did I mention I sell drugs?"

Well, I [?] whatever drugs you got
I'm talking crack, pills, heroin
Even if it's legal drugs, I'm talking Advil, Claritin
I'll throw your bitch off the roof like I'm Dan Bilzerian
I'll throw your shoes on the phone line while your man's still wearing 'em

You wife her, I'll snipe her like click click boom, La Di Da Di
She on the patch then I'm Slick Rick smooth
I'll send a photo of the bands then send a dick pick through
That's the chicken and the beef like a McPick 2

But I got a top five reasons you should not rap

Number 1: you are a cable guy for Comcast
You know what? Fuck the list, we can stop flat
Reasons one through five, they are all that

Fucking cable guys deserve a special section of Hell
Where the Devil tortures them sometime between 7:00 and 12:00
Fucking Ferry the Cable Guy, our second battle isn't stressing me
But I feel like Matthew Broderick cause the Cable Guy is obsessed with me

So this for every time you said 5:00 and showed up after 6:00
This is for every strangers toilet that you clogged with a massive shit
This is for every shitty operator y'all have ever had talk to me
Every one of them in India who claims their down the block from me

Fucking cable companies are an inherently un-American symbol
Comcast runs a Monopoly and you just play the thimble

So I want remunerations for dealing with your faggot shit
So after I beat you, you're hooking me up with all of the sports packages
You know what? Fuck all the sports packages
I don't want sports packages let me be more accurate
I want the porn packages
Fucking Skinamax? Gimmie that
Bunny Ranch? I fucks with that

He's already asked but here's something you should know about me now
If I can't have battle rap I will burn it to the ground
I mean, Dizaster's been ducking me like I'm not in that class
Dizaster's been ducking me like some kind of Math class
I heard Tay Roc run his mouth, how is he a threat?
Bro, I would take care of Roc/rock like a Chia Pet
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a PG vet
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a vet PG
I whip Roc/rock like Nash when he's MVP
I would get rid of rock like an NBD
I'll 30 Rock/Roc like the studios at NBC

And y'all might think I'm losing focus, but maybe you should know this
Before the battle I Instagram'd evidence that he doesn't write his own shit
So log onto @adamferrone to read every word now
Or just wait cause we'll get into it in that third round

Yo, you mentioned my homie Ron...I swear to God I'm a writer
Bitch I could check this dick and feel nothing, I'm like Bonnie Godiva

They said, "Caustic, did you see Day 1? 'Cane was snapping."
I was like, "Yeah, yes. But all his good lines were about me so I guess he still needs Caustic bars to get a major reaction."
I said, oh you didn't buy nothing right, 'Cane?
What the fuck were you paying for when you made the transaction?
You know what? You can just walk around with this L but I guess Stranger Things have happened

I said my dude came
It was three years I was hoping that you'd change
But you're still the same bum begging for bars with loose change
I said you still got your mouth wrapped around another dude's name
You're like a shamed Olympian blaming the steroids for the poor decisions that you made

I said, Al can fucking blow me
At this point Al owes me some alimony
Acting like I snitched on somebody, no I just alerted my actual homie
About some fucking stranger who didn't pay me the fucking full amount that he owes me

But I'm no angel though
We've all gotten a couple bars along the way, you know?
But shit if we wanna talk about the ratio
I don't need a bunch of Facebook conversations posted to tell you what I gave to Rone

Oh...did you forgot?
When we were out there in England?
Don't Flop for the weekend
You couldn't finish your rounds cause you was too busy drinking
I gave you a whole round for Youthoracle right in front of you without even blinking
You're like, "Hey, thanks Caustic I'm sorry I choked. But you don't write how I be normally speaking
But hey it'd be cool if we could keep this our little secret."

Awww, you little fucking faggot dude
Aye, you mad at me?
What about a week before your battle with T
And didn't have much help to give you but I did give you a little something didn't I you manatee

[Rone]

Never

[Caustic]

Never?
I mean imagine me
Bunch of people get credit for my writtens
But I can tell you like this, I've taken a lot less than I've given
So whoever's feeding you your information is telling you some fucking fiction
And besides, Erik Foreman helped you write this whole fucking battle so what's the fucking difference?!

No?

See, if you look at his name it'll prove that he's a hypocrite in the long run
Cause he likes to sit around and call people frauds even though you are/R one
I said I know who I am, these battlers should have a natural fear
But this is your second title match
I've had bars in title matches for the last three and half years
And if you're confused, you think that shit is weird
And you don't think that shit is actually true
Then why aren't you taking a second and ask half of the fucking battlers in this room

But it's Rone!

It's Rone who they've given me
He composes it like a symphony
He's simply, says simple things a bunch of filler schemes and similes
But he hides it behind this whiny high pitched delivery
So you can't tell he's the least quotable rapper in King Of The Dot history

I mean every since you became a little mini-celebrity
You think you got all the answers like that guinea from Jeopardy
I'm sick of this fucking rich dickhead kid disrespecting me
The only privileged I ever had in my life was a fifth of Hennessy
And after I finish that I'm gonna find your little sister Stephanie
And dig her the fuck out like a hysterectomy
See him and Erik Foreman have been on the internet instant messaging
Desperately trying to discredit me
To make me lose I swear to God they'll do anything

But, I've got enemies
Got a lot of enemies but both you faggots 'bout to get the same vasectomy

But since you're a man of education let's look at it scientifically
You lost momentum while I gave it a simple transfer of energy
Cause if you break it down to the chemistry
Your volume to the masses doesn't have any density
Cause even in the most basic of matters
You just can't trust Adam/atom cause they make up everything

[Rone]

You're a liar bro. You're a liar

[Caustic]

I'm a liar? I'm a liar?
That's your observation?
The best you got is a 2012 Photoshop conversation?
Suck a fucking dick?
That shit is fucking finished
You're supposed to be a fucking champion, now you out here coming with gimmicks

Dude that shit is fucking actually true
If you were a real fucking champion you would've showed up to the event and interacted with fans like champions do
Your trend ended before you started you're the Ed Hardy of battling dude

Dude, I was gonna retire after I won this shit

That's some shit I thought I never would say
I was just gonna take the chain and left y'all for dead
Then I thought about it, is that really how this legend will end?
Then I said, "Fuck it"
I'd rather stay and break Pat's record instead!

Let's go!

So this is not a regular battle round
You know, a verse on his weaknesses
So fuck a crowd, fuck a crown, these are personal grievances

So let's not mince words
You missed your first battle with Big T cause you were hung over from some bad coke
On Friday you're doing great, the next day you can't go
Once the fans had their money paid and that's why you're fucking fake
Cause you were in Chicago at the venue but couldn't go because a tummy ache?
Bro, what the F is that?
How is he your expecting champ when he might miss any heavy scratch from a bout of the menstrual cramps
Fuck losing any respect, mine for dude didn't exist
Cause I did the same drugs and was fine, your immune system's a bitch

But the very worst thing from the scene from that night
Worse than Mr. Free Drugs being a fiend for that white
Is your slogan, "Free Drugs" I was believing the hype
And then I watched you pay for those shitty drugs at a fucking premium price
I mean, what happened to the slogan dawg? I really believed that
When I say "Grandmom's favorite grandson" ask my grandmom I really mean that

But yo, there's something bigger about your fame that has driven me insane
How you made your whole name off of ghostwriting for Arcane
But behind the scenes us battlers know you in a different way
You are the most notorious recipient of shared bars in the game

Oh y'all want names?
Y'all want names?
Fresco never gave you bars?
Fredo never gave you bars?
Frank Stacks never gave you bars?
D-Lor never gave you bars?
Fucking Reverse Live never gave you bars?
Fucking Real Deal never gave you bars?
Bro, fucking Marvwon never gave you bars?
Madness never gave you bars?
Bro, and that's the ones I know, imagine ones I don't

Imagine all his secrets if that's the stuff he shows
I mean the first time he called me for bars we weren't even bros then
It was against fucking Roosevelt and that was back in '010

It's really just incredible what he does behind the scenes

{KOTD crowd member starts losing his fucking mind. Apparently shouting out at no one like he's on PCP or some shit}

I watched five battlers give him bars for Mr. 13
Vers' Arsonal, Chedda Cheese, every battle it's obscene
Last year vers' Big T it was full four bar schemes
And you still skipped the battle after I directly gave you bars
So stop lying you are not genius that you claim you are

Battles on 24 hours notice really aren't that exciting for him
When you realize he probably has like 24 writing for him
I mean, fucking getting bars, burning bridges, that just shows he's a selfish guy
His slogan "Free Drugs" that explains his health's decline
But after all his snitching it was on himself this time
Cause Mr. Free Drugs has always needed someone else's lines

And the way you vilified Arcane when you are ten times the cheater
That's like getting ethic lessons from fucking Carlos Mencia
Go and get your ghostwriters I guarantee they're not enough
Oh you write your own shit? Yeah so does Melania Trump

I said you really can't compare duke
I say shit they're scared to
You dig dirt, find someone that's written for me, I fucking dare you!

Bro, this is for all that bad karma you built up
All that cattiness displayed
Because all of that bad karma that comes back to you TODAY

So I hope you get STD's to what you said to Q-Shinobi
Based on what you said to K, I hope you lose one of your closest homies
For what you said to Caddy I wish you dope scared veins
And your mom deserves to die for what you said about Arcane
Based on Soul, I hope your girl moves away, far from you
From Jeff, I hope she cheats, just to make it hard from you
From Ex-I I hope you know the guy
And just to make it horrible
I hope it's one of your best friends from what you said to Arsonal
I hope they run a train on her from what you said to Cortez
I hope she gets a restraining order from what you said to Megadeath
Then I hope you get back together and the two of you have babies then I hope that fucking kid's retarded from what you said to Matt Daley

Bro, you are a rat and a snake

That's just how I see him
This is bigger than rap beefing, both coasts or regions
So I'm not lobbying for a win and I don't care if you believe it
But any league where he's the champ isn't one I want to be in!

Let's go man, that's it

Apologies to all my fans who been expecting a hit.
I had some real life issues come up to be dealt with a bit,
then i dropped twenty pounds, to pretend I was sick,
asked for Mook, and hoped no one would remember this shit.

This gon’ be different, Flex. I hope you warned your team.
A sad look, and I put that on everything; that’s the Jordan meme.
I came out west to say some shit that's sort of mean,
so you gon’ get killed at home by a dickhead, like that Clockwork Orange scene.

See, I already love this city. More than facts.
My bro Daylyt showed me all the best spots to get restraining orders at.

I said, “It's cool, you ain't gon’ do me no harm.
A ‘roid rage the only time you'll see a mad flex shooting them arms.

But fuck the jokes. Just keep a distance when we rapping,
‘cause I paid some cholos off that'll split you into fractions.

Think ticket sales, ‘cause if you fuck wit me, it's a killing;
give me limited space, and you gon’ get a buck fifty in the building.

They like, “E, that's how you punchin’? It's too soon.”
True. This shit I bottles up's a trip, like huffing on poop fumes,
plus a bar from MadFlex that's more than nice is sort of like an orange slice:
you getting it once in a Blue Moon.

I give a fuck what this douche bag fool packages.
Your crew's faggots, a fruit salad; it's too saddening,
and if your dudes acting true savages,
I'll Facebook spam you a few battles and
have you scared to remove tags like new mattresses.

Look, it don’t matter if y’all with the shit Flex brought.
As far as a Fresh Coast fit, you're equivalent to wet socks.
You probably spent this week sitting at your desktop,
trying to get hype while giving yourself pep talks and listening to Plex Rock .
Meanwhile, I been whipping up a fresh pot.
The way I'll son you’s different; I ain't kidding, I'm your step-pops.
Like midgets serving top shelf liquor how you'll get stopped,
‘cause the bar's been set so high that you can’t even hit me with your best shot.

So, I don't want to hear no shit that end with “Eas(z)y, E”.
You got to go crazy; thinking out your right mind's your only chance of seeing me.

And yo, that shit was fucking nice.
I'm breaking down your thought process,
‘cause the right side of your brain's what makes a vision come to life.

And you could Ask Jeeves if you ain't ever known,
the shit I bring smarter. King Arthur: if you got a point to set in stone,

get taken out. I’m nicer wit the quotes.
It ain't an issue to get Mad shelved when everything he’s writing is a joke.

I could’ve said “magazines”, like clips that jam,
since I'm known to pop punks but got a Simple Plan
to have you looking stupid over nothing(nutting) quicker than a minute man.
You just gon’ stand there and give me the win, ‘cause you my biggest fan.

Yo, round one, we ain't gotta discuss it.
I swear that was my lightest shit. Well, actually, it probably wasn’t.

Shouts to the vets ducking that battle with Flex.
Real Deal said financially it has to make sense,
but he might shut that shit down in your class if you're ten.
I know, you making big moves, Trevor; we won't ask you again.
Hey, fuck him. I picked a writer that I had to respect
and brought him out to the West. That's not true. I have to confess:
I came to see if a virgin could have a dad bod, and the answer is yes.
The man ain't a threat.

Like I'd have a hot battle
with a dude who'd eat a condom full of heroin, and then not travel.

Look at you. You still booking through false bravado,
and I wasn't askin Avo to talk to Hollow,
but every time I hit up G's it was  followed by silence; it was not staccato.
They don't get it. Weak today, hot tomorrow.
Most of what I spit go over heads: I'm Triple H with that water bottle,

so try to follow. But we building a classic,
like.. Nah, fuck that, you sound better when you absent.
Get cracked and do the math, then flush it down the toilet,
it's no portable TheSaurus girl: I came to put this whole card on the canvas.
Boy, you ‘bout to get your ass kicked. Get ravaged; one jab clip
turn him around quicker than walkin by a bad chick.

You don't have shit. Nah, Fuck You; you see low green(Cee-Lo Green).
He’ll catch the first 48 from my last three 16's.
Add it up. You wack as fuck.
You need to give me more space than some JNCO jeans.

You ain't been killing shit like I've been.
Women's bathroom: go ahead and freshen up, fuck how hot the line is.
Tread light, and get a grip though; you been out of alignment.
I follow E.F with that G check, I ain't alphabetizing.

This is second nature.
You always got some mark down watch like a jealous neighbor,
but the cliche suits you: that's the yellow ranger.
Don't get in danger. Keep pitching these bitches that less is greater
and watch him hit the floor so many times, now you an asshole on an elevator.
…And I wrote that before Money Bagz; he no showed. To hell with haters.
I still miss Caddy. Show up like Will Smith cabbie:
Eyeball that Fresh plate, everyone in yo' home smell you later.

I'm nice.
Thank you. I need that rack, ‘cause, that's your cue to break out,
’cause you ain't solid enough for stripes.

Fuck your life. I struck the light under the butane for him.
Veruca Salt round: dude can fall down with these goose eggs on him.
You ain't near my level; pipe down, but you ain't warpin.
No arrogant talk back, from the best Eric in Talkback..
Ah, Farrell(feral). That's a starved cat. Man, you ain't Foreman!
If these words hit a nerve, it ain't a toothache forming.
This is not a drill. Lets get back to the root. Wait for it.
Dolla dolla bill: I'm back building with my face forward,
‘cause a dollar bill got a building on the back and a face forward.
You like that?
The lesson of the day going, don't show up to the game if you ain't scoring.
Man, I keep hearing E pushing keys. I mean, maybe, do you play organ?
Like, what, you got “haymakers for neighsayers”? If you train horses,
you pay for it, I corpse him with a Liu Kang horsekick.
Fuck around and it won't matter if the shoe game horrid.
I boot his lip, the 12 wings turn to the Flu Game Jordans.

What up, Spice Rack? Nah, me and you, the pay grade ain't the same rate.
Book club: I just got to make sure we on the same page,
‘cause all your punches hit, but they whip before they nae nae.
Start buttin’ in, I could start button him, and save this played game.
Believe me, uh(bulimia), I put a lot of time into this straight waste.
I didn't want to work this out in my house,
but I’d look so fucked up if I skipped you; this is Leg Day.
Good luck man, don't get your shit kicked off of the main page.

I took this matchup ‘cause you got a fire pen.
I mean, to me your writing’s number one, on a scale of fucking five to ten.
They say you like a white Passwurdz with the style, when
you more like an incorrect password; check your caps lock and try again.

It's tiring how you cramming your rhymes.
A flight delay when you write that way, ‘cause shit ain't landing on time.
We see you ramble on lines
and try n meet today(2-day)’s standard with a rushed delivery like Amazon prime.

I know your flow's the core of how you open doors,
but when these leagues got feeling you under pressure,
kinda like the ocean floor,
you need to punch with conviction, focus more,
‘cause when you choose to speak it's a nudist beach:
you nowhere(no wear) close to sure(shore).

You ain't suited up to play here. I’m better.
Plus, you did your last three matchups in this format, and that ain't very clever.
You should learn to change gears whenever,
‘cause the point of going Back to Basics isn't just to fucking stay here forever.

That's why you should shut your mouth.
I got a punch for every Cali match you had no one gave a fuck about.

So those that ducked you probably got a point.
Why test Flex(-)ability in this(dis-)location,
when he proved that he can't get it popping in the joint?

And I hope you thought that shit was soft.
I wrote a flex ability bar just ‘cause I know how much they piss you off.

See, disrespect’s what I'm ‘bout.
I once battled Cortez and choked the whole time,
just so the footage wouldn't ever come out.

I’m different. See, Flex cool, but I was best left off alone,
and since this corn rose(rows) to the occasion,
if he get it twisted here(hair), I'll knot his dome.
I’ll tell him, “Watch how u talking, homes,”
‘cause dog'll get a two-piece in his mouth
like the sunscreen bottle if he cop a tone(Coppertone).

Life's a beach; I’ll catch you trying to kick up your feet in sand,
and pull up in the Jeep wit some big shit to sweep the land.
Even if you bring the pigs, I’ma get to meet(meat) with cans, like eating spam,
sock a(soccer) bitch and let it kick over green; that's Mia Hamm.
I know because we seasoned fans, it seems we fam.
I'll tell you that I need a hand, then have you flying from a hook; you Peter Pan.
We should at least had planned to put up each a grand,
‘cause I ain't got to post my Don't Flop battles in Talkback to see a band(banned).

At this point, killing all y'all is too necessary.
Facts(fax). I'm getting paper for the principle(principal): school secretary.

Charge a rack for a mixtape feature.
You should probably take notes from the kid like a fifth grade teacher.

Anyone who think I'm Stephen Curry getting thirty’d by Flex
is talking crazy out the ass: Eddie Murphy in Shrek.

Round two, I ain't came for classic.
I put Brian in a box,
like a guy whose name was Brian died and eventually was placed in a casket.

Putting this cub scout on the thug route, was whose decision?
Was it you? Come get him. I'll wait, I'm used to chillin,
like... Any bark, ’n’ E. (N.E.) heart break, that's New Edition.
Your moms mastered the science of fucked up genes(jeans): that's True Religion.
Schemes: but I don’t buy it, he lose commission.
Get through the mission.
I know Bad Dudes; you know Shaq Fu. We moving different.
Tell Avo this shit is Roscoe’s; I'm through with chicken.
He spent his life as a proven victim, ya'll knew the symptoms,
and y’all react to his fake ass punches? Fuck ya'll. Two for flinching.
I'm too efficient.
Look, do I choke? No. You get bars ’til you stop: I use submissions.
I got goons to kick in
and, pop, put money under a pillow, you'd think a tooth is missing.
Boom, hit him. Mix the jab-cross with the shoe position
’til that hook follow a tackle, and I ain't tuna fishing.
I'd supply some good advice if you would listen.
They just got to add a little paper to cook E(cookie); that's Confucianism.
At this point, I'm just fooling with him.
Call up Dot and let that "um Berretta" open up in his house,
like, "we ain't worried ‘bout superstition."
Eric, I fuck with you… Youtube ‘ll get it.
I fuck with you, but you a mild substitute, a euphemism.
I got charm ’n(Charmin) wipe my ass with fabrications you have written.

Truth to fiction: Spice Rack, go hold down the herbs,
but I'm known round the world,
and you known ‘cause Bangz louder than a comb down with a curl.
He say he pop Molly?  He will throw down with a girl,
and you can pick up the pieces.
Tell this chump I want some background funk: we playing Toejam and Earl.

Look at me, dork.
The hands come out for a broken man down, it ain't the peace corps.
You leave, or get hammered in a trunk, now you a tree fort.
What the fuck you want it with me for,
when you looking as uncomfortable as you without a keyboard,
and hella squares on his side like Nike Elite shorts?

I got messages for squares, so, grab a Post-it.
It's just a little light when you snap; that's a glow stick.
Who you roll with?

What? Ya'll break my shell for the cream like crab chowder?
That coward couldn't break news if he was Matt Lauer.
Flex: rap game Jack Bauer.
No Chilla Jones shit, like "tear a wrist when Mad counters”,
it just takes a week to learn what I've done in the past hour.
Keep the soda. Teach him yoga; dog posing flat downward.
You'd get caught if you got into dirt, that's warning track power.

Relax. There ain't no reason to score this match.
Just upload the shit to YouTube with a corpse attached,

I'm so beyond. I mean, you know me. Obi Wan, ‘cause I can force the hand.
I'm through with this moving through duplicates, ‘cause this ain't Orphan Black,
and I ain't holding back without a torture rack.
A single punch ravage through his body and transform a cat,
and Ravage a Transformer cat, so when I say transformer: facts.
But if i spoke like you, it's "fayacts".
But when I say transformer, facts,
‘cause first it meets the eye, then you get more than that.

Motherfucker, now you die, and I’d bet one or two lives
that you ride with a bank account balance that fucking matches your shoe size.
In summary, Eric, your mama should’ve got her tubes tied.
Fuck you, guy.

I got a story that might just make your day. (It might not, either.)
One time I faced a j, then hit the club to sip some Tanqueray.
I threw my balls at your bae(bay) like the A's came to play.
She didn't didn't shut my game down; just covered all bases; that’s a rain delay.

Translation, homie: I got drunk as shit and fucked your bitch.
I’m kidding; I just got drunk as shit and let her suck my dick.

She even topped the whole squad off ‘cause she likes the whips we drive.
Before she left, everyone was blew(Blue): Eifell 65.

Fuck your life. That's some shit I’m hating on,
‘cause to me, son ain't really that bright, out here trying to break a don(of dawn).
Its like as a baby, you was dropped by your crazy mom,
and your head had taken more hits than my favorite bong.

But you don't smoke pot. That got me really surprised;
this whole venue’s stoned, bro, even the ceiling is high.

Real rap, I bet you're prolly mad at weed,
and think that being a pothead
will surround you with more fruits than fucking Johnny Appleseed.

See, getting fucked up's just something Flex don't need to write raps.
Pull a  joint out, he gon’ look at you like Jesus Christ's back.
Go to spark it, he’s like, "please don't light that,”
then he just might snap and kill the buzz like a Venus flytrap.

But try that here, I ain't gon’ be the one thats laughing;
out of nowhere, I’ma get it shaking with Flex: muscle spasm.

If I throw a left fist or right at homes, his nose ‘ll break.
Then he gon’ feel right at home with a red bridge like the Golden Gate.

Yeah. Fuck stretching em wit a Ruger.
I’ma take you to school, and then teach you a lesson like I'm your tutor,
like how Avocado booked this and CT’s 3 hours ahead:
I'll be talking to a vegetable in the future.

Yeah, so you gon’ lay with your frame broke.
I got a gun that spit so crazy, shit came with a raincoat,
and when I pop it at your face and your brain smoke,
your third eye could open up, but you ain’t gonna stay woke.

I ain't trying to have Flex offended, just flex my pen,
‘cause I got less than 10 bars ’til we back to being friends again.

It's just sad I had to fuck up your movement.
Never should’ve got Mad in the first place, like I jumped to conclusions.

They say my drive been watered down; that's a car pool.
But I think I still spit solid; that's hard drool.
If they said you heating up, it's just ‘cause you aren't cool.
Plus, all your punchlines are shit: you have bar stools. (Boo.)

I got bigger fish to fry, and Brian ain't an obstacle.
Now I got to stick with jokes like I ate a popsicle.
Plus, that MadFlex name is comical,
‘cause you getting straight bodied, while I'm bending over backwards
just to make it possible.

I said I cared about this, I probably lied.
I just wanted free tickets to see Carter Deems live.

And that’s still on the bucket list.
That's all for now folks. If MadFlex ain't at World Dom I’ll be fucking pissed.

(I don’t want to be mean to you for another round, Eric. It’s gonna go bad.)
You came out here looking like the product of some one night stand with Absyrd-
(No, you don't understand, it gets worse.)
You came out here looking like the product of some one night stand with Absyrd
did the fucking fusion dance with a Amber Alert.

That still ain't better than a no show.
I start attacking E ’til plasma streaming from his head; wanna Go Pro,
then you curl up, and I leave on a high note like Soul Glo.

Frodo, this charity. I mean, it may be deductible.
These motherfuckers paid you in Lunchables.
Don't talk about money. If he do, don't trust this fool.
Lactose intolerance, ‘cause you just got a little cream,
and it makes me uncomfortable.

Bump knuckles, we’d catch a case like fuckin bellboys.
If you flex an arm connect, it is a frontal deltoid.
You got more goons in JeFF’s Mustang than the one that fell Troy?
Cool. The whip next to the ratchet, shit, I'm Uncle Elroy.

You hear that? Get used to those.
It just happens when a true man show versus the Truman show.
Here's some shit that some of ya'll hoopers know.
He missed his shot, but he goes down no matter how you spin it.
What's that?  Shooter’s roll.
You a troll. You got "da feet" bars. I'd never use one though,
‘cause I don't fuck around with da feet, boy, I'm in cruise control.
The usual. The 50 Super Bowl dumped roman numerals,

A.K.A. Take this L, you played yourself.
It's "let's work" ’til the network make a joke disappear;
this one here Dave Chappelle.

Well, you a little more Velma, Shaggy, Brennan Dassey.
I'm an athlete,
and Clark Kent came out the booth like, "I thought I was half geek".
Half the room knows, Dan Larusso with the bad knee
is the only time in his life that he's seen somebody clap heat.
Now, I can't tell if you animated or anime, kid; your style is mad cheeks.
20 battles, I still ain't heard you to rap, E.
Get the picture; I tag E. Collapsing back teeth all hit the damn street.
He pick it up, pick it up, pick it up; that's Black Sheep.
I'm nasty. Fix the crib for your girl like Nick and Gatsby,
then your Boo ain't never leaving the house; it’s Mr. Radley.

High school education bars.
You ain't a star, Farrell. Fuck rap. Your whole stack fit into a mason jar.
I lay a beat down until E sound like bass guitar.
You a shooter? No. You get Happy to play for par,
and you pay a goon or two to root for you cause you can't raise the bar.

Jackass. Nah, the care package void.
Get drilled for real, a southpaw to scare Pastor Troy.
You lack the poise.

I mean, you something that these squares can enjoy,
but you fronting in the hood so hard the airbag deploy.

You terrible. I throw my fist in just to fish from the bottom barrel?
This bull come to a close(clothes) like the Rock's apparel.
I am not comparable.
You keep ignoring the cost. You Horrible. Boss,
I'll kill him, why you callin’(Colin) Farrell?

This a waste of movement,
‘cause you mixing in more fake drums than eighties music,
and I start to feel a hatred brewing.
I mean, it’s Eas(z)y, E, and for the Record, it may be Ruthless.
But you not my cup of tea ‘cause the tables turned: that's a lazy Susan.
I hate these new kids.
They ain’t proven, and they ain't seen shooting.
I got a gun in the safe with the safety safely rooted
and I did not bring the shit, I ain't gon’ use it.

Look at him. You don't let the tech blast. I don't stress that.
True to form, Human Torch:
you (poof) hold your fire when you get mad. You get that?

Nah, Flex- that jabroni is Dellavedova to Kobe,
puttin’ Goldberg the wrestler vers’ Goldberg the goalie.
Dethrone me? Hoe, please. Your whole steez is dopefiend.
I'm so deep in the game even the old me was an O.G.
White man flash (slap), red hand, don't crosswalk no streets.
Me and E trade, my stock too high; those seats come with nosebleeds.
I'm testing switchblades on resting bitch face. You the homie.
You the first person I'll tell when I tell ‘em that I got 0-3ed.
Eric I got 0-3ed.
Organik, if I'm not on World Dom than you can blow..
your money, elsewhere, it's your loss, O.

Michael Pointer

I don’t care if you came with a few new choppers/
Rocket launcher bigger than 2 Chewbacca’s/
You move to awkward, everything my pen touch breaks like voodoo doctors/

These punch lines heavy, they can suit you proper/
You ain’t gotta be smoking 2 feel (2 phillies) these oowap ya/
Losing to me, that’s an uncool (uncle) death, like scar when he through Mufasa/
I’m putting you close to the flame like you knew waka/
You in my town now, they like who you patna!/
KC! Tell Saint the only Mic we rock with is Moustakas! (Royals 3rd baseman)/
Loose Screw Pasta- It’s a reach, but I’m crazy off the noodle – I’m good aak/

I know how to handle my leverage, I could pull up and make the hood pop/
Bar 4 Bar I’m nice too, off that strength alone, a 30 I could drop/
But why would I when I also got performance for days, like Woodstock/
Bro I wish you would stop…. cuz let him tell it over/
He’s stacking bodies on top of bodies... Like he can smell the odor/
Oh you can sir (cancer)? Well what gets under my skin like melanoma/
Is the fact you’ve only beat a couple backup PGs… Don’t nobody brag about crossing up Delladova!/
The realest Soldier… I’m not a Fan of ya movement/

Scratch that! If ya man jump in, I’ll put your dog in a bag, that’s a purse with a Shih Tzu/

Don’t go bezerk church, I didn’t curse I said purse with a “Shih Tzu”
Mic this Rd gon’ feel longer than a church service I sit through/

But this first isn’t even the worst I promise that 3rd gonna get you/
So fall in line! And I’ma tell’ him GOD IS GOOD! All the TIME!

Y’all probably going to say I’m going to Hell after this.

But if yall know anything about Saint Mic biblically then you know at the least lyrically it’s kind of my job to beat the “Hell” out of him.

I mean you on “Fire” right now baby.

Even locally has the potential to sell out events; so to sell out he vents.

Cause whether the money fast or it’s moving slow even a tortoise know he gotta “Shell” out the rent so..

Why yall think I’m out here battling this old, Grinch that stole Christianity in the face looking as bitch. “you’re a mean one”

Charging all these people to come out here and watch you pre judge they brethren all while you praise the Heavens, but what the Hell happened to you upper lip?

I know we aint discussing dogs in heat but aint “thiiiiis bout a fucking bitch”?

Only member of Beard Gang w no mustache cause every time he tried to grow one the hair just sliiiiid of yo fuckin shit.

It’s Saint Mic vs the youngest Ned Flanders Oh, howdaly doodaly, Wow you’re so new to me! Honestly I don’t know what to say to you.

Old Bearenstein Bear cliff lip having ass look like your whole life consisted of playing flute. (whistle)

And your ancestors got me so conditioned to believe Jesus is White when I heard you bring Jesus to fights I aint know whether to come here and beat your ass to death or pray with you.

But since the goal of Christianity is to be Christ like I figured like Christ either was is cool; that’s right guys he forgave you too, and you gone have to do a whole lot more than punch, scheme, and scream in Jesus name to make this debatable.

What if I told you God hated you?

And made you pay me to come here and Kill you as a way of proof; could you play it cool?

You know being denied entrance through the pearly gates of truth, after making all these people believe he favors you? And ironically the little angry black guy is the one who had a place for you?

You know if somebody asked me that I couldn’t answer scrap just know this ass whipping gone feel the same…..I’m pretty much describing the rest of your day for you.

You know how I know you’re a gimmick?

Because you use religion as a common ground turn around, judge me on how I vent my evils.

You know how I know you’re a gimmick?

Cause as a Christian you know damn well this aint the place where we supposed to portray we’re equals.

You know how I know you’re a gimmick?

Fuck that I don’t even need to just know I call my self Saint Mic because I’m that good with one, that’s just me fool.

Cool cause I got more men (Mormon) to prove Karma’s a bitch and in the end (Indian) Karma is right behind you (U). Oh what? I know it sounds like a reach, but it is true because if you’re indian then Karma is right you’d be Hindu;

What we doubt the bars? Only reason I was Tsu “surfing” the heavens in that last line was to prove it don’t take a trophy rapper to reach out to God. Aaaaaah.

How about you remind everybody here that you’re a part of the biggest Mob in the world and that Bible got more bodies on it than any dirty pistol in any one of my niggas neighborhoods.

You know what the crazy shit is? Last time I battled a white boy worth mentioning he practiced Atheism. I told him he was the same as Christians.

Another man corrupted by a butt fucking lame conviction, plagued with Pagan and plagiarism used to control and help him cope with the way he living. Say it isn’t? Next round not only am I going to state specifics I’m a make it vivid, go ahead with ya little criticism about my career and ya Saint flips nigga.

That was pretty nice kid. But let me show you how to damage the nicest. Through channeling vices.

Most celebrated bible thumpers was later exposed as some sluts, like you about to be. Out here trying to get a good hold of some nuts and he aint clamping them vice-grips.

Don’t look at me King. Cause look too long and get his “Royalty Check” I’m strapped with the tools and no “mechanical license”.

You know I remember back when I first witnessed that one round extended match between you and some other senseless act. And you mentioned that you got into rap to talk to nonbelievers and bridge the gap.

And in the very instance you spit that rap I genuinely commended that, but something didn’t match so I listened back something missing scrap… I mean outside the fact he’s Christian, raps. At home and on sight (site) shout out ya Journalist for that. He believes in scripture, but puts his ten percentage in it as; Faith in God but not in man, who inspired by God wrote the book from where he gets it at so….Out side of a couple Christ flips and the aforementioned facts…..what’s so Christ Like about what this nigga yaps?

Is it the Self Proclaimed righteousness via passive, aggressive, ambiguous attacks? Or the fact he has yet to mention any Devine message given, or expressed suggestion on how we should be giving back? See now I gotta ask where your intentions at?

And how do you plan or intend to bridge the gap between this and that? When it’s pretty specific that in this extent of rap the jist is that you go tit for tat. Wits get matched by way of some pretty judgmental and offensive raps to win the match; lift his stats, get some scratch. And by doing so, the losing opponents opportunities are actually slimmed in fact, so I’m saying where exactly is God’s gift in that? I’m not implying I’m confident that it’s nonexistent, but if so how do you plan to implement it skrap?

I don’t think you got the answers Sway. So allow an Emcee with no gimmick to kick the facts. All my real niggas know we vent the violence to prevent the violence and that right there is God’s gift to rap. So don’t come up here, lying in who’s name you preaching ya false teachings like you came here to heal the streets with that. We are positive and negative by God’s design, and even He know where I’m from just venting, rather than doing the shit is about as positive as niggas gonna be with rap, so bitch keep ya act.

It’s like yall gas his bars cause he told you he works on behalf of the staff of God. And yall just believed it. Well he doesn’t have to cuss in his bars. Not afraid to say he fears God, he’s not a fraud just flawless, a marketing genius. How? If I didn’t know no better I’d think you think he getting phone calls with some fucking exclusive offers from Jesus.  It aint Sunday. If yall need to know more of the bible nigga, yall should just read it!

That mutha fucka aint stashed in the Vatican or with Smack and them all vaulted and secret. He aint Cortez. Just another Christian with an agenda hidden for attention to his name through a mission that for Centuries already been force fed.

See what A Wards using is better known as Consumer relation. A little marketing tactic, publicly owned, were he’ll say yall his brothers and sisters but really view you as consumer related. So he sat back, studied, and consumed the relation; same way Christian Pilgrims that was cruising them Slave Ships () that moved to the States did. Seeking to start a new civilization, they claimed they’d teach a new “civil” way to elude and portray that they cool with its Natives. And look who doing the same shit! Using his faith as a tool of invasion, borrowing another groups innovations’ in hopes the consumer relates so he can consume what they making.

But like most I see the Greed in you. Yea you been impatient. So allow this surgery I give you be inpatient. And all you fake teachers, preachers, doctors, polices, all involved; if I gotta come back and slaughter hogs I’m a get this whole strip baking (bacon). Mack a mockery of mine I’ll come back and kidnap your first born daughter dog for having my identity a lil mistaken (miss taken) bitch. Aint no way he can say he killing me, for the rest of his life he’ll view this battle as a Slim Shady inury, and embrace (Em, brace) the shit!

I figure since we here, let’s have some dialogue/
Right now, I want to talk with Saint, later we’ll get the Mic involved…
You see that Word Saint, holds a dear meaning to me, because I walk in light/
I too am considered a Saint, but we don’t walk alike/
The Greek word is Hagios (HA GE OSE), Morally blameless, physically pure, sacred/
But first let’s bring that to context before we got into more layers/
There is none without Sin, That’s why Christ came and in light, Scripture
Depicts him as Jesus of Nazareth (a Jew), I’m not sure who that dude is in the White pictures/
But Ride with me. . . His death and resurrection became the atonement for our lives/
Therefore through Grace by Faith; we have hope that is in God/
So as I servant we are covered, we’ve been washed from the stains right/
So we’re called Christians And that is the definition of a Saint, Mic../
Now correct me if I ain’t right, I feel you telling God “this ain’t my cup a tea”
When he lookin back like it could’ve been this…. Saint Mic up a T…
Now I won’t sit up here and say you’re lost;  Cuz I don’t know you from Adam/
But it does seem we’re cut from different fabric, so I should probably show you the patterns/
Ever FELT you were Caught in (COTTON) a mess let’s say the Rents due/
It’s a tough(FLEECE) lease, you and roommate don’t MESH and you’re spent too/
You sat an (SATIN) thought about it, cuz you owe a band and Plug is getting a cut/
So (SEW) what he need’ll (NEEDLE) put you in the read (THREAD), unless you get to stitchin him up/
Yall wasn’t listenin up!
…. Cuz some of yall looking at me like son that’s whack!
But I said we cut from different Fabrics so you gon think its fire when I … (run that back)

*Runs back with emphasis on scheme*

Let’s get to stitching him up!
I said we’d get around to Mic Right?/
Well I’m old school like Yak Bak’s and a Lite Brite/
If I wanted I could put you in this knapsack Night Night!/
So thank God I’m a changed Man!
Cuz Grace is that Gap between Michael and this Stray Hand/
I don’t play fam…
It’s not fair to rappers/
Another REASON, I see you base (CUBASE) your LOGIC off being a PRO with TOOLS
but I can tell you’re soft where (Software) it matters/
Who engineered you? If something this Foul Can reach the Top – think Julio Stretching/
It’s nothing to Hit him High – that’s Coolio Message/
When a Wolf in ya face, - it ain’t Rubio Pressin!/
This for every time a Mic issue, messed up anybody’s Studio Session/
Move to the side, cuz we on Next/
They overhyped you like you Go’Rilla cuz you Beat on Chess/
I’m not convinced, Yall can hashtag Rise of the Saint!/
But right, now you lookin 5ft 5 in the Paint! – Lord stop him, Ford Shopping Go Find an Escape/
Let’s get rid of him, Death Certificate, just sign and then date/
A different breed of Killer, Use kindness and faith/
This battle bro, Plaxico, your shots were a Giant Mistake/
Stop the Gun Talkin, you Son’s watching…. He gon’ mime what you say/
Tell your 4th Grader you love him, that’s how a real man looks a 9 in the face/
*Slogan*

Jesus Christ, ya boy just doesn’t get it. Broke em down, two rounds, he still trying to punch his lil heart out.  Got the nerve to stand here all poised in his position.  We all seek gain in the name, but to convince his niche he’ll tell you it’s just poison that I’m spittin.  And maybe you right. Through all the damage I’ve provided, it does seem like I’m glamourizing violence but this aint me glamourizing this me getting the poison out my system.

God’s gift to man was free will. You know, choices and decisions. So what’s worse. Me up here hypothetically enforcing my existence or you forcing his conviction? I mean all the theatrics, running back to ya man dapping, fake laughing for consensus yet the hardest thing to do for you Christians, is listening!

Initially, I comprehended ya mission was to fill us with hope. Show us how to follow the will of the G.O.A.T., put down the pills and the dope, not criticize and try to kill us with quotes, or did you forget God will judge us both?  Look how many people came here for ya show, and judging by ya battle with FMag before you speak God’s will, you will judge an ear studded nose…. Well that’s not Christian like…

But it is his type. Pathetic! The source of your hunger…synthetic. And even my stomach will tell you the real source for hunger is pain. You in this shit for your benefit not his ya bitch and the proof is all in this pigeon’s name. You want an Award?

Well you gone have to get it like Tyson nigga let’s get loose. I mean you do have some “nasty stuff” in them “sucky rounds” to be “white, shit”…In other words Anubis was clit, and you tit juice; and I don’t think you want me to squeeze to get proof.

Fuck a Flanders. You softer than some girl butt. Cant handle the bars get curled up, from these “ten speeds” leave em “rotten” for the “cabbage” turn Kimzy into Kimchee.

Greed, sloth, pride, wrath, gluttony, lust, envy; there’s seven deadly sins and at the least bitch I am three. Till I Die im a keep it “100” I’m man of the “Century”.

Look at his face. He gone try to say he isn’t bothered. But he is. Starting to realize the difference between his creator and his father. You get to ask God “What?” I gotta ask him “Why?” We say two different prayers, we are two different problems!

This “Man” up to “Bat” and, you niggas “Gotham”. I do what I want here, who finna stop him. You? Nigga stop it.

Ah shit. I’m bout to make it hard for the world to defy me why, because 95 percent of you battle rap niggas a bunch of “bitches slapping bitches” around….Why are you trying to be the next Heidi Fliess (female Pimp)? I don’t know. But pussy nigga if I find out you out here pitching Christian, flipping bitches, or slicing pies; I will make sure every D Boy in ya crew will get murdered quick to put the “tools to your servers” I’m the IT Guy!

Yea I’m the IT factor. I kill a clown (Killer Clown) “Pump” to a “Writer” mouth. “Horror Fiction” aint ya job homie. You know the movie “It” factored in a Killer clown, and since he was in fear in the end I switched gears and came with “eight arms” on me. Saint Mic, Only angel that can blaze you niggas yea I’m strapped with the Saviors Sinner the wrath of God on me!

KC. Cuz ya family? Understandably.  But since yall locked in “A Ward” perhaps I should free you of some of the Insanity, I mean. Come to these pussies. Regardless of what he believes you can believe we dumpin. I’m a MidWest Dickhead Cunt how could you not “see me coming”?

I don’t care if we moving it’s Christmas, we smoking, Leftovers, nigga you can’t rap better than me in nothing!

You softer than ya baby pictures. Yall know Greek Mythology? Who gives a fuck! One to his “Cap” make em “invisible” Im a make it “hard to see the God” like he Hades nigga. My left, Wyclef have a wack spiritual rapper running for Haiti nigga. We thrive when it’s beef you’ll die in the streets I ride with a piece (peace) you couldn’t see (C) my “Class” in a Mercedes nigga.

**Missing Bars**

I will kill any that fight foul with me, wild as me? How is he? You deliver it quite cowardly I’ll hit you in yo chest so hard it change the logo from die daily to die hourly.

Heavenly Father (Prayer) I have not come to challenge you but more so the institutions that you bounded to. I was told to not “shoot” the “messenger” so I bring no disrespect to the Father. I just want him to “shoot” this “message” to SAGA.  (click) BLAKA!
