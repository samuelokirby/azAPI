Im the only rapper that these people really care for
Youre the reason theres security in the airport
Id tell you to suck my dick but that might be racist
Plus I dont want to get my shit caught in your braces
Maybe you deserve those, youre tiny as fuck
You get to stay up on your feet when a dude needs his dick sucked
I know I got a lot of faults, Im aware of all that
But how you say you want beef when you allergic to that?
Fuck you, Its time to quit your bitchin
Imma put this shit on Worldstar with the title "White Boy Kills Brown Midget"
(Worldstar nigga sleep!)
Fuckin up with that haircut, head shaped like Spongebob
Youre trying to sell drugs like you think thats a fun job
Fuck that, and fuck you
Whens the last time you heard your parents say "I love you"
Hows it feel to know that I will always be above you
I aint talkin height now, Im talking on some other shit
Lyrics, Flow, Spiritual, Im always on some other shit
You say you get ass, but youre hooking up with Davids friends
After he is done with them and Baby J is sexting them
I could make a whole mixtape about you, thats some diss songs
My dude got suspended from his own prom
Cause he knew that he couldnt get a date to his own prom
But even David got one
How bout that
All these girls think youre cute
But not in a "date way"
More like an a "Oh, this little kid wants to play!" way
Well except for Mikayla, I heard you guys had a ball
But I was talking to Cristian, he said your penis was small

*beat drops*

You talk about ambition
Say youll make a lot of money one day
Think the journey is all games and fun
But when its all said and done
And Im successful and won
Youll end up working at Tonys
With your little pink gun
Running errands for David
Not even making a fraction of what Arash does

Youre up

You half a fool, you optimist
I see you like my optometrist
You talk about my girlfriend, but you aint never really had one
Well Emma in the backseat, but you aint never really had one
You say Im fat and all, but thats because youre scared and small
You never had no self esteem, had to build a twitter regime
To get some good feedback, cause in real life, you aint have that
I killed you in no time at all
Perfected rhymes and called you small
It took you twice the time as me to talk about some Adderall?
My response is half as long as yours, but this the most important verse
93, we with gardening tools
We all state, you aint starting fools
Took a dream from in my head, groomed it, grew it, now heres The End
Kasey is my dawg and all
Thats why hes KaseyBark, yanno
B Clark, Midgey, Durbsman, IceBox, Kimu, Labes, Billy
They been here since the start, but now its winding down around the bend
Thank you all for listing, this is The motherfucking End

I hear you talkin shit, bro you think youre the heat
Please bow down to defeat youre barely mince meat
Stop with the street talk, and start to do the street, walk
Lock yourself in and tell me this, how you gonna battle with this sick shit that I spit bitch
See you still flappin your jaws, prepare to be thrown in the ocean
In the middle with jaws
Or prefer to be served and severed with claws, knock on the doors Of absolute death you may
But please be ready for the automatic failures you may make
So take this and wait for another dismembering, remembering
The tethering of your dream and how it was minced to pieces
Believe in yourself please, to save you now youll be needin
Help from Jesus
You think Im copy, pastin please, tell me how youre actin up
Better be quite or Ima bout to bitch smack your mouth shut
For good, yeah man talk the hood talk better go back and walk the hood walk you aint had the taste of a real G
Get back down to your level and prepare to be beat
Writin on your sheet, like youre deep please bitch your weak
You aint on my level or a level at all, take a vacation
Up the damn wall and fall
Humpty Dumpty, I must be rusty but you better knock the shit Down if you goin against me
Im hard to beat, youre hardly cheese compared to these beats And this emcee
You ready, alright, so come on down, I bet you to do it
Lets see if you got the balls or if youre just truant
To me, yeah lets keep an eye, on your ass as the heat intensifies
Talk to me in a smart tone, prepare to meet your demise
Throw you, a hundred million miles is what Im finna do
Call me Son Goku
I already told you, what Im gonna do, finna plow through
Yeah man try to tackle a topic more intense then mine
I always rap from the heart, make the fake rappers sigh
But I really really dont give at all a flying fuck
My chance of making this shit is the same as seein a flyin truck
Or it could all depend on some serious luck
Maybe Ill release a track that is heard my millions
Make it big and to the top and make billions
But thats a dream for another day, Im here to take you down
Dont care what you say
Freestylin this rap shit to the grave
Rap battlin bitches in my spare time for loose change
Please, all of you fake ass rappers are plan
Make like like a plane and take the next trip away
Far away, from here I dont need to here your shit anymore
Im tired of it now, next place to be, will be a fuckin morgue
But let me just let you all know this, Im sick of it, all of it
So listen next time I write another track
Listen to the facts I spit, and find it through my old wack rap crap
I know Ive said some shit, that know I demise
But just look at my own and, your own life
But this time, through my eyes
I got a couple little bitches that need a little call out
But Ill reside, got more and more, dont get me wrong
Now get the fuck back home and call your mom
Continue to rap please, just leave me alone
Im done hearing wack disses like this
Im sick of this, listening to this petty as shit
Bitch


I said whats up homie? Welcome to your own lobotomy
You may have sent Dirtbag Dan back to local comedy but aint no one stopping me
We are World Domination 6, right? The whole globe is watching
Aint that about a bitch? Like a Rone biography

I said my dude, Im honestly happy for you
I thought youd never be the champ son
Shit, we six bars into this title match
and its already better than the last one

I mean Im way too advanced son I can do shit that youve never did
Thats why I gotta take his last breath before he get a second wind
I mean I heard you was gonna get personal with me, I mustve got in his head
Yall been begging for a king but instead you got a God in the flesh

You want your style...your style? Is as obvious as it gets
You rap like how bitches talk to their pets
Like, "Oh, you gon rap like this is things you gotta handle
Oh. You gon talk to Daniel like a Cocker Spaniel AARF!
Boy I catch you slipping on yo campus while you flannel
Boy I gotta choppa knock you out your socks and sandals!"

This so dont panic, your punches do no damage
Ill [?] turn your nose into nothing but bone fragments
Body blows, give him a bleeding heart like a hopeless romantic
Im nomadic, I leave Earth with no hope of going home to my own planet
You my bro Adam but that dont mean I wont got at him
Throw blows at him, bury him up to his throat and throw stones at him

You get cold feet? I toe tag you
You know that chrome Magnum
But that forehead cro magnum
My bullets hit you ricochet and hit Gully and Organik

I said they keep calling you a king but I think this king needs the boot
I mean honestly this whole chain needs a control+alt+delete and reboot
This guy called me a fucking "weed" man
But I think we can see the truth
I think hes just jealous of the weeds at least weeds has some roots

I mean my dude, you dressed up like fucking Abraham Lincoln trying to gain some views
And then you rapped about freeing slaves while all the black people tried to escape the room
The craziest shit is
Out of all the angles this lame could use
Its funny you dress like Abe Lincoln but youre the one getting the chain removed

Im way too smooth, you aint never been great
Lets face facts Adam Im already a legend today
But I swear to God the only thing black in your house is electrical tape
He probably calls the cops on his own shadow like, "Stop him. Hes getting away."

Youre a fucking faggot with no stripes

You wanna gamble but no dice
This fool Adam is so white he wont even reach in his bars
Hes had everything handed to him his whole life

I said, hell out write me and then out white me
You dont want to mess with dude
Hes never struggled a day in his life, his parents put him on a pedestal
Hes got a top five but no non-white rappers
Hes got a tattoo right above his champ stamp that says #Alllivesmatter
He loves chai tea, tai chi
He hates Spike Lee, doing The Right Thing
He loves Skyping, typing, hiking, biking
The word "Reiching", evidence hiding, stereotyping, racial profiling
Pretty much any white thing

Homie...you aint anything like me
You aint prepped for survival
Cause a year from now, nobodys gonna remember when you went viral
You may have cheated death before with Illmac but now your destination is final
We can all judge this book by this cover cause the story ends with the title

Thats one BITCH!

Roney Bae the King, formerly the prince
I call him "Cocker Spaniel" cause hes always been my bitch

Oh, so youre the super villain career ender
Well I dig that
I heard you even ended a marriage before, well thats a sick stat
But my rhymes change lives too, you doubt my impact?
Have you seen Big T lately? Hes 170 with a six pack

World Domination
What? I gotta break him down geographically?
I mean Taiwan fucks with me
I guess I got that Taipei (type A) personality
I mean chickas want my Calvins off
No strap to get my style across
Cause I rap like I got an Eagle thats the size of an albatross

I was whipping the drop Regal thats blacker than Don Cheadle
Youre pall (Paul) bearer, the jaw (John) ring gon (Ring) say "shells these are not Beatles"
Do you like your pops leave you
Horror script and the plots evil
And I already killed you once, my stories dont got sequels

Ill run up on him like the Rocky steps
Slash him with a hockey stick
I killed him once, I gotta kill him again like hes a zombie flick

But theres no skeletons in my closet so this aint another body
Youre only as good as the dirt you have and you have nothing on me
I mean, I didnt cheat on my girl, not a whore in my house
But not because I have morals let me just dispel that lie now
And not because of love, let me shoot that right down
I didnt cheat cause I was scared fucking Caustic would find out

Fucking Sherlock Holmes

He bides his time, thinking hes kinda sly
Stealing receipts, checking what I would buy like some kind of private eye
But I got hip to the game quicker, were not painting the same picture
Kay wigger? Theres a difference between a dirt digger and a grave digger

See, youre finished

Well...done stick a fork him
The mortician the 28.4 liter Ford engine
The unicorn Im Porzingis in the form with it
Im Ben Simmons on the floor spinning
A centaur while hes formed shifting but Caustic is just
Light and projection, its pure physics

You had the same hair/beard combo as every pussy at Coachella
So you can not be hard, its a simple little fact
Plus you have the same voice as the pig from Toy Story
So its only right I dump that nickle in his back!

Yo, Ill hit your niece with the braces
Get her tea bagged til her teeth snag, Im her new dentist

You fuck with [?] I use her team flag as a skeet rag
Ill let the team shag
I could get half of your family tree bag
Your baby mom is 43, does speed and lets her jeans sag

Your baby mom looks like a drag queen, Ill get your queen dragged
Rip his beard off, do his Adams apple like a speed bag
I dont care if Souls punch was softer than a fucking bean bag
You got slapped and just stood there just like that shit was freeze tag

I mean, daaaaamn Daniel
I bet that pussy wet as dam Daniel
That pussy got man handled
He hit it then kick it out he told to go pan handle
Watch me grand stand you
Van Damme you
Damn Daniel you dont understand Im snuffing your mans candle

Watch me back stab you, over and over again like the needle gone on a back tattoo
Check, check, Martin Havlat you
Fold him, zip him, knapsack you
Style on him, Rat Pack you
Whip my phone out, fucking battle and beat him then fucking Snapchat you

But wait, wait, wait, wait

Maybe, keeping it all rappity rap is keeping it too basic
So if I acted how you act, well how would you take it?
Cause if I was you, I would probably name your girl and call her "a hot mess"
If I was you, I would take your statements out of context
If I was you, Id go low and come at your pops next
If I was you, Id probably blame you for Cadalack Rons death
I mean, getting high, getting high-


Listen to me Caustic! Listen to me Caustic!
Getting high in front of a recovery addict, why would he need that?
I cant believe that
So if I was you, I would probably blame you for his relapse

But Im not you

Im not you
I just know my friend would like to hear his name dropped
And I miss him
You miss him too?
Well Ima put you in the same spot
Rest in peace, thats one

Ooooh, hes gonna get personal with me, Oh gee golly wiz I cant wait
Why dont you go drink some fucking bleach since you think being whites that great
You used to be my right hand man, now you dont deserve my handshake
Game Of Thrones shit, still the King Slayer even though my right hand fake

I said I wish a motherfucker would, I be chopping em down
Blocks will come out, I be making Mr. Booblaka Chilaka Boo sounds
When it comes to rapping bitch Ive been snapping longer than locker room towels
Ill have you stretched on a table with the doctors around
Just to tell you you ass out like a hospital gown

Oh...so I was walking around thinking like, "Dude
What would make Adam just madder than hell?
What would take all the wind outta his sails."
Then he said, "Well we should mention our girls names."
Well, dont you date that bitch Allison Dale?
Yeah? Why dont you pass the message to that slut and tell her I can excel in every way that Adam has failed
If you look at her pictures, her eyes are sad you can tell
Shes so used to having two hands grabbing her tail
And get her asshole impaled by more African males than a crack addict in jail

And thats hard...

You know, thats a hard thing to live up to
But he makes up for it with a strong back rub and a solid "I love you."
He be kissing that bitch on the mouth like its the love of his life
But deep down he knows he just aint fucking her right
Shes got the Black Snake Moan she likes a little mud in her pipes

I dont even know why she fucks this guy
Hes all types of bitch, hes got red lips and rosy cheeks
Who the fuck you supposed to be? Tyler Swift?
You fucking giant vagina lip

I dont get what part youre not understanding
I dont know any other man in the world that couldve called to have a mirror match with a tranny
I mean this is the difference between us
Yall looking at a glimpse of a genius
But with all these pussy ass feminine little physical features
We all agree, theres No Shame if you decide to get rid of your penis

Well hold on, I got a question
How come every time somebody mentions a time Rone got molested
His face immediately looks like he just got a Botox injection?
Now, its my chance to get him so, I better get him

I mean, fans love to tell you what you can and cant talk about but you know me, I never listen
They said "Its an automatic loss if you talk about Sandusky or any of his alleged victims."
Well as far as Im concerned if you getting defensive about getting molested then you probably got fucking molested with em

Now I know talking about Sandusky is played but yall know I got a little something to say
To be honest Adam, Ive uh...studied your case
And Im not saying that being molested makes somebody gay
But...you were on the track team
At any point did you consider just...running away?
Is that not something you would try?
I mean all those years of learning how to take a baton from behind
Its like you learned nothing from the guy

I mean maybe thats why your little album Committed was trash
You havent dealt with all that shit from your past
Maybe all those Sandusky dicks in your ass changed your pitch when you rap
All those sexual assaults and you never did nothing back?
You got raped by your running coach no wonder you sound like such a bitch on your tracks

See I like saying shit like that just to watch him get rattled
But if you wanna see some really weird shit, why dont you check out his Complement Battle
Now, the second I turned it on I knew there was something fucking strange going down out here
But it did answer a long time question
Whos dick do you gotta suck to get a title shot around here?

And then you think and its just you know, its just Adam and Patrick
Theyre always coming up with the wackiest antics
You know, running around Canada, acting like faggots

But thats the part that makes me think somebody really raped you
Maybe you overplayed the gay thing to cover up how uncomfortable it actually makes you
So while you were out there pretending to be a couple gay dudes
How about the fact that for all that gay shit you did, Pat never actually paid you

Awww, this shit just got incredibly real

Aye, he done sucked a dudes dick and didnt even keep up his end of the deal
Adam calling every day and Pats like, "Dont worry Adam you getting it still."
And then you took him out to dinner in L.A. and you got fucking left with the bill

Thats amazing, my dude Pat, screwed you for two wacks
And you didnt do shit bitch, what part of Philly did they do that?
I mean and I dont blame him, look at Pat, hed fucking whoop his ass

He wasnt trying to scuffle but he played it like it was an accident but you actually kind of got hustled
I bet you was having Sandusky flashbacks yelling at Pat like, "Why did I trust you?!"
It sucks Adam you just cant help but get fucked by the guys you look up to

I said you either real or you aint dawg, there aint no in-between
We aint cut from the same cloth, Im tailor made for the game or so it would seem
Cause when it comes to rhyming Im on top if you know what I mean
You a cup of noodle, Ill peel your lid back just to blow off some steam

Infrared beams look like techno lasers
Dealership maintenance you just met your maker
So nows a good time to go ahead and accept yo savior
Before I make the Devil your fucking next door neighbor
I said thats a sign youre a bitch, I aint here to impress no haters
I said the deuce deuce is a good buy/bye, I protect my paper
In a fair one, you wont fare well, I dont respect yo gangsta
Plus I got a piece so long itll catch you later

Bitch


Man, that fucking gangsta shit is the weirdest shit Ive heard about you
I talked to the rest of the white battle rappers and to be honest
The fellas are getting worried about you

Bro, its like you cant decide if youre Jamal or Geppetto
An Italian who acts black? Where you from? The Spaghetto?

Talking about this fake drug dealer shit
Selling, copping, never stopping
Bragging bout who he sold to, Benny, Robby, Jenny, Johnny
He even made a deal in a Dennys lobby with Hammurabi
Bro, you know who else sold weed before? Fucking everybody!

Bro, my little sister, sold packs of loud shit
You dont hear her bragging bout it
My grandmas stylist was packing ounces
Shit, so was my dads accountant

If you do all this secret illegal shit then why would you tell us?
Hes like, "Gangsters move in silence
And did I mention I sell drugs?"

Well, I [?] whatever drugs you got
Im talking crack, pills, heroin
Even if its legal drugs, Im talking Advil, Claritin
Ill throw your bitch off the roof like Im Dan Bilzerian
Ill throw your shoes on the phone line while your mans still wearing em

You wife her, Ill snipe her like click click boom, La Di Da Di
She on the patch then Im Slick Rick smooth
Ill send a photo of the bands then send a dick pick through
Thats the chicken and the beef like a McPick 2

But I got a top five reasons you should not rap

Number 1: you are a cable guy for Comcast
You know what? Fuck the list, we can stop flat
Reasons one through five, they are all that

Fucking cable guys deserve a special section of Hell
Where the Devil tortures them sometime between 7:00 and 12:00
Fucking Ferry the Cable Guy, our second battle isnt stressing me
But I feel like Matthew Broderick cause the Cable Guy is obsessed with me

So this for every time you said 5:00 and showed up after 6:00
This is for every strangers toilet that you clogged with a massive shit
This is for every shitty operator yall have ever had talk to me
Every one of them in India who claims their down the block from me

Fucking cable companies are an inherently un-American symbol
Comcast runs a Monopoly and you just play the thimble

So I want remunerations for dealing with your faggot shit
So after I beat you, youre hooking me up with all of the sports packages
You know what? Fuck all the sports packages
I dont want sports packages let me be more accurate
I want the porn packages
Fucking Skinamax? Gimmie that
Bunny Ranch? I fucks with that

Hes already asked but heres something you should know about me now
If I cant have battle rap I will burn it to the ground
I mean, Dizasters been ducking me like Im not in that class
Dizasters been ducking me like some kind of Math class
I heard Tay Roc run his mouth, how is he a threat?
Bro, I would take care of Roc/rock like a Chia Pet
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a PG vet
Bro, I would take care of Roc like a vet PG
I whip Roc/rock like Nash when hes MVP
I would get rid of rock like an NBD
Ill 30 Rock/Roc like the studios at NBC

And yall might think Im losing focus, but maybe you should know this
Before the battle I Instagramd evidence that he doesnt write his own shit
So log onto @adamferrone to read every word now
Or just wait cause well get into it in that third round

Yo, you mentioned my homie Ron...I swear to God Im a writer
Bitch I could check this dick and feel nothing, Im like Bonnie Godiva

They said, "Caustic, did you see Day 1? Cane was snapping."
I was like, "Yeah, yes. But all his good lines were about me so I guess he still needs Caustic bars to get a major reaction."
I said, oh you didnt buy nothing right, Cane?
What the fuck were you paying for when you made the transaction?
You know what? You can just walk around with this L but I guess Stranger Things have happened

I said my dude came
It was three years I was hoping that youd change
But youre still the same bum begging for bars with loose change
I said you still got your mouth wrapped around another dudes name
Youre like a shamed Olympian blaming the steroids for the poor decisions that you made

I said, Al can fucking blow me
At this point Al owes me some alimony
Acting like I snitched on somebody, no I just alerted my actual homie
About some fucking stranger who didnt pay me the fucking full amount that he owes me

But Im no angel though
Weve all gotten a couple bars along the way, you know?
But shit if we wanna talk about the ratio
I dont need a bunch of Facebook conversations posted to tell you what I gave to Rone

Oh...did you forgot?
When we were out there in England?
Dont Flop for the weekend
You couldnt finish your rounds cause you was too busy drinking
I gave you a whole round for Youthoracle right in front of you without even blinking
Youre like, "Hey, thanks Caustic Im sorry I choked. But you dont write how I be normally speaking
But hey itd be cool if we could keep this our little secret."

Awww, you little fucking faggot dude
Aye, you mad at me?
What about a week before your battle with T
And didnt have much help to give you but I did give you a little something didnt I you manatee

[Rone]

Never

[Caustic]

Never?
I mean imagine me
Bunch of people get credit for my writtens
But I can tell you like this, Ive taken a lot less than Ive given
So whoevers feeding you your information is telling you some fucking fiction
And besides, Erik Foreman helped you write this whole fucking battle so whats the fucking difference?!

No?

See, if you look at his name itll prove that hes a hypocrite in the long run
Cause he likes to sit around and call people frauds even though you are/R one
I said I know who I am, these battlers should have a natural fear
But this is your second title match
Ive had bars in title matches for the last three and half years
And if youre confused, you think that shit is weird
And you dont think that shit is actually true
Then why arent you taking a second and ask half of the fucking battlers in this room

But its Rone!

Its Rone who theyve given me
He composes it like a symphony
Hes simply, says simple things a bunch of filler schemes and similes
But he hides it behind this whiny high pitched delivery
So you cant tell hes the least quotable rapper in King Of The Dot history

I mean every since you became a little mini-celebrity
You think you got all the answers like that guinea from Jeopardy
Im sick of this fucking rich dickhead kid disrespecting me
The only privileged I ever had in my life was a fifth of Hennessy
And after I finish that Im gonna find your little sister Stephanie
And dig her the fuck out like a hysterectomy
See him and Erik Foreman have been on the internet instant messaging
Desperately trying to discredit me
To make me lose I swear to God theyll do anything

But, Ive got enemies
Got a lot of enemies but both you faggots bout to get the same vasectomy

But since youre a man of education lets look at it scientifically
You lost momentum while I gave it a simple transfer of energy
Cause if you break it down to the chemistry
Your volume to the masses doesnt have any density
Cause even in the most basic of matters
You just cant trust Adam/atom cause they make up everything

[Rone]

Youre a liar bro. Youre a liar

[Caustic]

Im a liar? Im a liar?
Thats your observation?
The best you got is a 2012 Photoshop conversation?
Suck a fucking dick?
That shit is fucking finished
Youre supposed to be a fucking champion, now you out here coming with gimmicks

Dude that shit is fucking actually true
If you were a real fucking champion you wouldve showed up to the event and interacted with fans like champions do
Your trend ended before you started youre the Ed Hardy of battling dude

Dude, I was gonna retire after I won this shit

Thats some shit I thought I never would say
I was just gonna take the chain and left yall for dead
Then I thought about it, is that really how this legend will end?
Then I said, "Fuck it"
Id rather stay and break Pats record instead!

Lets go!

So this is not a regular battle round
You know, a verse on his weaknesses
So fuck a crowd, fuck a crown, these are personal grievances

So lets not mince words
You missed your first battle with Big T cause you were hung over from some bad coke
On Friday youre doing great, the next day you cant go
Once the fans had their money paid and thats why youre fucking fake
Cause you were in Chicago at the venue but couldnt go because a tummy ache?
Bro, what the F is that?
How is he your expecting champ when he might miss any heavy scratch from a bout of the menstrual cramps
Fuck losing any respect, mine for dude didnt exist
Cause I did the same drugs and was fine, your immune systems a bitch

But the very worst thing from the scene from that night
Worse than Mr. Free Drugs being a fiend for that white
Is your slogan, "Free Drugs" I was believing the hype
And then I watched you pay for those shitty drugs at a fucking premium price
I mean, what happened to the slogan dawg? I really believed that
When I say "Grandmoms favorite grandson" ask my grandmom I really mean that

But yo, theres something bigger about your fame that has driven me insane
How you made your whole name off of ghostwriting for Arcane
But behind the scenes us battlers know you in a different way
You are the most notorious recipient of shared bars in the game

Oh yall want names?
Yall want names?
Fresco never gave you bars?
Fredo never gave you bars?
Frank Stacks never gave you bars?
D-Lor never gave you bars?
Fucking Reverse Live never gave you bars?
Fucking Real Deal never gave you bars?
Bro, fucking Marvwon never gave you bars?
Madness never gave you bars?
Bro, and thats the ones I know, imagine ones I dont

Imagine all his secrets if thats the stuff he shows
I mean the first time he called me for bars we werent even bros then
It was against fucking Roosevelt and that was back in 010

Its really just incredible what he does behind the scenes

{KOTD crowd member starts losing his fucking mind. Apparently shouting out at no one like hes on PCP or some shit}

I watched five battlers give him bars for Mr. 13
Vers Arsonal, Chedda Cheese, every battle its obscene
Last year vers Big T it was full four bar schemes
And you still skipped the battle after I directly gave you bars
So stop lying you are not genius that you claim you are

Battles on 24 hours notice really arent that exciting for him
When you realize he probably has like 24 writing for him
I mean, fucking getting bars, burning bridges, that just shows hes a selfish guy
His slogan "Free Drugs" that explains his healths decline
But after all his snitching it was on himself this time
Cause Mr. Free Drugs has always needed someone elses lines

And the way you vilified Arcane when you are ten times the cheater
Thats like getting ethic lessons from fucking Carlos Mencia
Go and get your ghostwriters I guarantee theyre not enough
Oh you write your own shit? Yeah so does Melania Trump

I said you really cant compare duke
I say shit theyre scared to
You dig dirt, find someone thats written for me, I fucking dare you!

Bro, this is for all that bad karma you built up
All that cattiness displayed
Because all of that bad karma that comes back to you TODAY

So I hope you get STDs to what you said to Q-Shinobi
Based on what you said to K, I hope you lose one of your closest homies
For what you said to Caddy I wish you dope scared veins
And your mom deserves to die for what you said about Arcane
Based on Soul, I hope your girl moves away, far from you
From Jeff, I hope she cheats, just to make it hard from you
From Ex-I I hope you know the guy
And just to make it horrible
I hope its one of your best friends from what you said to Arsonal
I hope they run a train on her from what you said to Cortez
I hope she gets a restraining order from what you said to Megadeath
Then I hope you get back together and the two of you have babies then I hope that fucking kids retarded from what you said to Matt Daley

Bro, you are a rat and a snake

Thats just how I see him
This is bigger than rap beefing, both coasts or regions
So Im not lobbying for a win and I dont care if you believe it
But any league where hes the champ isnt one I want to be in!

Lets go man, thats it

Apologies to all my fans who been expecting a hit.
I had some real life issues come up to be dealt with a bit,
then i dropped twenty pounds, to pretend I was sick,
asked for Mook, and hoped no one would remember this shit.

This gon be different, Flex. I hope you warned your team.
A sad look, and I put that on everything; thats the Jordan meme.
I came out west to say some shit thats sort of mean,
so you gon get killed at home by a dickhead, like that Clockwork Orange scene.

See, I already love this city. More than facts.
My bro Daylyt showed me all the best spots to get restraining orders at.

I said, “Its cool, you aint gon do me no harm.
A roid rage the only time youll see a mad flex shooting them arms.

But fuck the jokes. Just keep a distance when we rapping,
cause I paid some cholos off thatll split you into fractions.

Think ticket sales, cause if you fuck wit me, its a killing;
give me limited space, and you gon get a buck fifty in the building.

They like, “E, thats how you punchin? Its too soon.”
True. This shit I bottles ups a trip, like huffing on poop fumes,
plus a bar from MadFlex thats more than nice is sort of like an orange slice:
you getting it once in a Blue Moon.

I give a fuck what this douche bag fool packages.
Your crews faggots, a fruit salad; its too saddening,
and if your dudes acting true savages,
Ill Facebook spam you a few battles and
have you scared to remove tags like new mattresses.

Look, it dont matter if yall with the shit Flex brought.
As far as a Fresh Coast fit, youre equivalent to wet socks.
You probably spent this week sitting at your desktop,
trying to get hype while giving yourself pep talks and listening to Plex Rock .
Meanwhile, I been whipping up a fresh pot.
The way Ill son yous different; I aint kidding, Im your step-pops.
Like midgets serving top shelf liquor how youll get stopped,
cause the bars been set so high that you cant even hit me with your best shot.

So, I dont want to hear no shit that end with “Eas(z)y, E”.
You got to go crazy; thinking out your right minds your only chance of seeing me.

And yo, that shit was fucking nice.
Im breaking down your thought process,
cause the right side of your brains what makes a vision come to life.

And you could Ask Jeeves if you aint ever known,
the shit I bring smarter. King Arthur: if you got a point to set in stone,

get taken out. Im nicer wit the quotes.
It aint an issue to get Mad shelved when everything hes writing is a joke.

I couldve said “magazines”, like clips that jam,
since Im known to pop punks but got a Simple Plan
to have you looking stupid over nothing(nutting) quicker than a minute man.
You just gon stand there and give me the win, cause you my biggest fan.

Yo, round one, we aint gotta discuss it.
I swear that was my lightest shit. Well, actually, it probably wasnt.

Shouts to the vets ducking that battle with Flex.
Real Deal said financially it has to make sense,
but he might shut that shit down in your class if youre ten.
I know, you making big moves, Trevor; we wont ask you again.
Hey, fuck him. I picked a writer that I had to respect
and brought him out to the West. Thats not true. I have to confess:
I came to see if a virgin could have a dad bod, and the answer is yes.
The man aint a threat.

Like Id have a hot battle
with a dude whod eat a condom full of heroin, and then not travel.

Look at you. You still booking through false bravado,
and I wasnt askin Avo to talk to Hollow,
but every time I hit up Gs it was  followed by silence; it was not staccato.
They dont get it. Weak today, hot tomorrow.
Most of what I spit go over heads: Im Triple H with that water bottle,

so try to follow. But we building a classic,
like.. Nah, fuck that, you sound better when you absent.
Get cracked and do the math, then flush it down the toilet,
its no portable TheSaurus girl: I came to put this whole card on the canvas.
Boy, you bout to get your ass kicked. Get ravaged; one jab clip
turn him around quicker than walkin by a bad chick.

You dont have shit. Nah, Fuck You; you see low green(Cee-Lo Green).
Hell catch the first 48 from my last three 16s.
Add it up. You wack as fuck.
You need to give me more space than some JNCO jeans.

You aint been killing shit like Ive been.
Womens bathroom: go ahead and freshen up, fuck how hot the line is.
Tread light, and get a grip though; you been out of alignment.
I follow E.F with that G check, I aint alphabetizing.

This is second nature.
You always got some mark down watch like a jealous neighbor,
but the cliche suits you: thats the yellow ranger.
Dont get in danger. Keep pitching these bitches that less is greater
and watch him hit the floor so many times, now you an asshole on an elevator.
…And I wrote that before Money Bagz; he no showed. To hell with haters.
I still miss Caddy. Show up like Will Smith cabbie:
Eyeball that Fresh plate, everyone in yo home smell you later.

Im nice.
Thank you. I need that rack, cause, thats your cue to break out,
cause you aint solid enough for stripes.

Fuck your life. I struck the light under the butane for him.
Veruca Salt round: dude can fall down with these goose eggs on him.
You aint near my level; pipe down, but you aint warpin.
No arrogant talk back, from the best Eric in Talkback..
Ah, Farrell(feral). Thats a starved cat. Man, you aint Foreman!
If these words hit a nerve, it aint a toothache forming.
This is not a drill. Lets get back to the root. Wait for it.
Dolla dolla bill: Im back building with my face forward,
cause a dollar bill got a building on the back and a face forward.
You like that?
The lesson of the day going, dont show up to the game if you aint scoring.
Man, I keep hearing E pushing keys. I mean, maybe, do you play organ?
Like, what, you got “haymakers for neighsayers”? If you train horses,
you pay for it, I corpse him with a Liu Kang horsekick.
Fuck around and it wont matter if the shoe game horrid.
I boot his lip, the 12 wings turn to the Flu Game Jordans.

What up, Spice Rack? Nah, me and you, the pay grade aint the same rate.
Book club: I just got to make sure we on the same page,
cause all your punches hit, but they whip before they nae nae.
Start buttin in, I could start button him, and save this played game.
Believe me, uh(bulimia), I put a lot of time into this straight waste.
I didnt want to work this out in my house,
but Id look so fucked up if I skipped you; this is Leg Day.
Good luck man, dont get your shit kicked off of the main page.

I took this matchup cause you got a fire pen.
I mean, to me your writings number one, on a scale of fucking five to ten.
They say you like a white Passwurdz with the style, when
you more like an incorrect password; check your caps lock and try again.

Its tiring how you cramming your rhymes.
A flight delay when you write that way, cause shit aint landing on time.
We see you ramble on lines
and try n meet today(2-day)s standard with a rushed delivery like Amazon prime.

I know your flows the core of how you open doors,
but when these leagues got feeling you under pressure,
kinda like the ocean floor,
you need to punch with conviction, focus more,
cause when you choose to speak its a nudist beach:
you nowhere(no wear) close to sure(shore).

You aint suited up to play here. Im better.
Plus, you did your last three matchups in this format, and that aint very clever.
You should learn to change gears whenever,
cause the point of going Back to Basics isnt just to fucking stay here forever.

Thats why you should shut your mouth.
I got a punch for every Cali match you had no one gave a fuck about.

So those that ducked you probably got a point.
Why test Flex(-)ability in this(dis-)location,
when he proved that he cant get it popping in the joint?

And I hope you thought that shit was soft.
I wrote a flex ability bar just cause I know how much they piss you off.

See, disrespects what Im bout.
I once battled Cortez and choked the whole time,
just so the footage wouldnt ever come out.

Im different. See, Flex cool, but I was best left off alone,
and since this corn rose(rows) to the occasion,
if he get it twisted here(hair), Ill knot his dome.
Ill tell him, “Watch how u talking, homes,”
cause dogll get a two-piece in his mouth
like the sunscreen bottle if he cop a tone(Coppertone).

Lifes a beach; Ill catch you trying to kick up your feet in sand,
and pull up in the Jeep wit some big shit to sweep the land.
Even if you bring the pigs, Ima get to meet(meat) with cans, like eating spam,
sock a(soccer) bitch and let it kick over green; thats Mia Hamm.
I know because we seasoned fans, it seems we fam.
Ill tell you that I need a hand, then have you flying from a hook; you Peter Pan.
We should at least had planned to put up each a grand,
cause I aint got to post my Dont Flop battles in Talkback to see a band(banned).

At this point, killing all yall is too necessary.
Facts(fax). Im getting paper for the principle(principal): school secretary.

Charge a rack for a mixtape feature.
You should probably take notes from the kid like a fifth grade teacher.

Anyone who think Im Stephen Curry getting thirtyd by Flex
is talking crazy out the ass: Eddie Murphy in Shrek.

Round two, I aint came for classic.
I put Brian in a box,
like a guy whose name was Brian died and eventually was placed in a casket.

Putting this cub scout on the thug route, was whose decision?
Was it you? Come get him. Ill wait, Im used to chillin,
like... Any bark, n E. (N.E.) heart break, thats New Edition.
Your moms mastered the science of fucked up genes(jeans): thats True Religion.
Schemes: but I dont buy it, he lose commission.
Get through the mission.
I know Bad Dudes; you know Shaq Fu. We moving different.
Tell Avo this shit is Roscoes; Im through with chicken.
He spent his life as a proven victim, yall knew the symptoms,
and yall react to his fake ass punches? Fuck yall. Two for flinching.
Im too efficient.
Look, do I choke? No. You get bars til you stop: I use submissions.
I got goons to kick in
and, pop, put money under a pillow, youd think a tooth is missing.
Boom, hit him. Mix the jab-cross with the shoe position
til that hook follow a tackle, and I aint tuna fishing.
Id supply some good advice if you would listen.
They just got to add a little paper to cook E(cookie); thats Confucianism.
At this point, Im just fooling with him.
Call up Dot and let that "um Berretta" open up in his house,
like, "we aint worried bout superstition."
Eric, I fuck with you… Youtube ll get it.
I fuck with you, but you a mild substitute, a euphemism.
I got charm n(Charmin) wipe my ass with fabrications you have written.

Truth to fiction: Spice Rack, go hold down the herbs,
but Im known round the world,
and you known cause Bangz louder than a comb down with a curl.
He say he pop Molly?  He will throw down with a girl,
and you can pick up the pieces.
Tell this chump I want some background funk: we playing Toejam and Earl.

Look at me, dork.
The hands come out for a broken man down, it aint the peace corps.
You leave, or get hammered in a trunk, now you a tree fort.
What the fuck you want it with me for,
when you looking as uncomfortable as you without a keyboard,
and hella squares on his side like Nike Elite shorts?

I got messages for squares, so, grab a Post-it.
Its just a little light when you snap; thats a glow stick.
Who you roll with?

What? Yall break my shell for the cream like crab chowder?
That coward couldnt break news if he was Matt Lauer.
Flex: rap game Jack Bauer.
No Chilla Jones shit, like "tear a wrist when Mad counters”,
it just takes a week to learn what Ive done in the past hour.
Keep the soda. Teach him yoga; dog posing flat downward.
Youd get caught if you got into dirt, thats warning track power.

Relax. There aint no reason to score this match.
Just upload the shit to YouTube with a corpse attached,

Im so beyond. I mean, you know me. Obi Wan, cause I can force the hand.
Im through with this moving through duplicates, cause this aint Orphan Black,
and I aint holding back without a torture rack.
A single punch ravage through his body and transform a cat,
and Ravage a Transformer cat, so when I say transformer: facts.
But if i spoke like you, its "fayacts".
But when I say transformer, facts,
cause first it meets the eye, then you get more than that.

Motherfucker, now you die, and Id bet one or two lives
that you ride with a bank account balance that fucking matches your shoe size.
In summary, Eric, your mama shouldve got her tubes tied.
Fuck you, guy.

I got a story that might just make your day. (It might not, either.)
One time I faced a j, then hit the club to sip some Tanqueray.
I threw my balls at your bae(bay) like the As came to play.
She didnt didnt shut my game down; just covered all bases; thats a rain delay.

Translation, homie: I got drunk as shit and fucked your bitch.
Im kidding; I just got drunk as shit and let her suck my dick.

She even topped the whole squad off cause she likes the whips we drive.
Before she left, everyone was blew(Blue): Eifell 65.

Fuck your life. Thats some shit Im hating on,
cause to me, son aint really that bright, out here trying to break a don(of dawn).
Its like as a baby, you was dropped by your crazy mom,
and your head had taken more hits than my favorite bong.

But you dont smoke pot. That got me really surprised;
this whole venues stoned, bro, even the ceiling is high.

Real rap, I bet youre prolly mad at weed,
and think that being a pothead
will surround you with more fruits than fucking Johnny Appleseed.

See, getting fucked ups just something Flex dont need to write raps.
Pull a  joint out, he gon look at you like Jesus Christs back.
Go to spark it, hes like, "please dont light that,”
then he just might snap and kill the buzz like a Venus flytrap.

But try that here, I aint gon be the one thats laughing;
out of nowhere, Ima get it shaking with Flex: muscle spasm.

If I throw a left fist or right at homes, his nose ll break.
Then he gon feel right at home with a red bridge like the Golden Gate.

Yeah. Fuck stretching em wit a Ruger.
Ima take you to school, and then teach you a lesson like Im your tutor,
like how Avocado booked this and CTs 3 hours ahead:
Ill be talking to a vegetable in the future.

Yeah, so you gon lay with your frame broke.
I got a gun that spit so crazy, shit came with a raincoat,
and when I pop it at your face and your brain smoke,
your third eye could open up, but you aint gonna stay woke.

I aint trying to have Flex offended, just flex my pen,
cause I got less than 10 bars til we back to being friends again.

Its just sad I had to fuck up your movement.
Never shouldve got Mad in the first place, like I jumped to conclusions.

They say my drive been watered down; thats a car pool.
But I think I still spit solid; thats hard drool.
If they said you heating up, its just cause you arent cool.
Plus, all your punchlines are shit: you have bar stools. (Boo.)

I got bigger fish to fry, and Brian aint an obstacle.
Now I got to stick with jokes like I ate a popsicle.
Plus, that MadFlex name is comical,
cause you getting straight bodied, while Im bending over backwards
just to make it possible.

I said I cared about this, I probably lied.
I just wanted free tickets to see Carter Deems live.

And thats still on the bucket list.
Thats all for now folks. If MadFlex aint at World Dom Ill be fucking pissed.

(I dont want to be mean to you for another round, Eric. Its gonna go bad.)
You came out here looking like the product of some one night stand with Absyrd-
(No, you dont understand, it gets worse.)
You came out here looking like the product of some one night stand with Absyrd
did the fucking fusion dance with a Amber Alert.

That still aint better than a no show.
I start attacking E til plasma streaming from his head; wanna Go Pro,
then you curl up, and I leave on a high note like Soul Glo.

Frodo, this charity. I mean, it may be deductible.
These motherfuckers paid you in Lunchables.
Dont talk about money. If he do, dont trust this fool.
Lactose intolerance, cause you just got a little cream,
and it makes me uncomfortable.

Bump knuckles, wed catch a case like fuckin bellboys.
If you flex an arm connect, it is a frontal deltoid.
You got more goons in JeFFs Mustang than the one that fell Troy?
Cool. The whip next to the ratchet, shit, Im Uncle Elroy.

You hear that? Get used to those.
It just happens when a true man show versus the Truman show.
Heres some shit that some of yall hoopers know.
He missed his shot, but he goes down no matter how you spin it.
Whats that?  Shooters roll.
You a troll. You got "da feet" bars. Id never use one though,
cause I dont fuck around with da feet, boy, Im in cruise control.
The usual. The 50 Super Bowl dumped roman numerals,

A.K.A. Take this L, you played yourself.
Its "lets work" til the network make a joke disappear;
this one here Dave Chappelle.

Well, you a little more Velma, Shaggy, Brennan Dassey.
Im an athlete,
and Clark Kent came out the booth like, "I thought I was half geek".
Half the room knows, Dan Larusso with the bad knee
is the only time in his life that hes seen somebody clap heat.
Now, I cant tell if you animated or anime, kid; your style is mad cheeks.
20 battles, I still aint heard you to rap, E.
Get the picture; I tag E. Collapsing back teeth all hit the damn street.
He pick it up, pick it up, pick it up; thats Black Sheep.
Im nasty. Fix the crib for your girl like Nick and Gatsby,
then your Boo aint never leaving the house; its Mr. Radley.

High school education bars.
You aint a star, Farrell. Fuck rap. Your whole stack fit into a mason jar.
I lay a beat down until E sound like bass guitar.
You a shooter? No. You get Happy to play for par,
and you pay a goon or two to root for you cause you cant raise the bar.

Jackass. Nah, the care package void.
Get drilled for real, a southpaw to scare Pastor Troy.
You lack the poise.

I mean, you something that these squares can enjoy,
but you fronting in the hood so hard the airbag deploy.

You terrible. I throw my fist in just to fish from the bottom barrel?
This bull come to a close(clothes) like the Rocks apparel.
I am not comparable.
You keep ignoring the cost. You Horrible. Boss,
Ill kill him, why you callin(Colin) Farrell?

This a waste of movement,
cause you mixing in more fake drums than eighties music,
and I start to feel a hatred brewing.
I mean, its Eas(z)y, E, and for the Record, it may be Ruthless.
But you not my cup of tea cause the tables turned: thats a lazy Susan.
I hate these new kids.
They aint proven, and they aint seen shooting.
I got a gun in the safe with the safety safely rooted
and I did not bring the shit, I aint gon use it.

Look at him. You dont let the tech blast. I dont stress that.
True to form, Human Torch:
you (poof) hold your fire when you get mad. You get that?

Nah, Flex- that jabroni is Dellavedova to Kobe,
puttin Goldberg the wrestler vers Goldberg the goalie.
Dethrone me? Hoe, please. Your whole steez is dopefiend.
Im so deep in the game even the old me was an O.G.
White man flash (slap), red hand, dont crosswalk no streets.
Me and E trade, my stock too high; those seats come with nosebleeds.
Im testing switchblades on resting bitch face. You the homie.
You the first person Ill tell when I tell em that I got 0-3ed.
Eric I got 0-3ed.
Organik, if Im not on World Dom than you can blow..
your money, elsewhere, its your loss, O.

But this first isnt even the worst I promise that 3rd gonna get you/
So fall in line! And Ima tell him GOD IS GOOD! All the TIME!

Yall probably going to say Im going to Hell after this.

But if yall know anything about Saint Mic biblically then you know at the least lyrically its kind of my job to beat the “Hell” out of him.

I mean you on “Fire” right now baby.

Even locally has the potential to sell out events; so to sell out he vents.

Cause whether the money fast or its moving slow even a tortoise know he gotta “Shell” out the rent so..

Why yall think Im out here battling this old, Grinch that stole Christianity in the face looking as bitch. “youre a mean one”

Charging all these people to come out here and watch you pre judge they brethren all while you praise the Heavens, but what the Hell happened to you upper lip?

I know we aint discussing dogs in heat but aint “thiiiiis bout a fucking bitch”?

Only member of Beard Gang w no mustache cause every time he tried to grow one the hair just sliiiiid of yo fuckin shit.

Its Saint Mic vs the youngest Ned Flanders Oh, howdaly doodaly, Wow youre so new to me! Honestly I dont know what to say to you.

Old Bearenstein Bear cliff lip having ass look like your whole life consisted of playing flute. (whistle)

And your ancestors got me so conditioned to believe Jesus is White when I heard you bring Jesus to fights I aint know whether to come here and beat your ass to death or pray with you.

But since the goal of Christianity is to be Christ like I figured like Christ either was is cool; thats right guys he forgave you too, and you gone have to do a whole lot more than punch, scheme, and scream in Jesus name to make this debatable.

What if I told you God hated you?

And made you pay me to come here and Kill you as a way of proof; could you play it cool?

You know being denied entrance through the pearly gates of truth, after making all these people believe he favors you? And ironically the little angry black guy is the one who had a place for you?

You know if somebody asked me that I couldnt answer scrap just know this ass whipping gone feel the same…..Im pretty much describing the rest of your day for you.

You know how I know youre a gimmick?

Because you use religion as a common ground turn around, judge me on how I vent my evils.

You know how I know youre a gimmick?

Cause as a Christian you know damn well this aint the place where we supposed to portray were equals.

You know how I know youre a gimmick?

Fuck that I dont even need to just know I call my self Saint Mic because Im that good with one, thats just me fool.

Plus something like “Gods Wrath” is what he uses for those that He brew (Hebrew). I am lethal.

I am Only here to trim the fat thats what I must slim (Muslim) when I see food.

So while these Christians deny the Jew they is (Judaist) I promise after tonight he will not see (Nazi) his people.

Oh Jew (you) mad? Nah Jew Gassed, and guess who brought that Chamber to sleep you.

And tell your people, I suggest they move in silence; cause whoever boo this (Buddhist) can get the piece (peace) too.

Or need I remind you? You not my brother, or kin (Orkin) Man, see your religion work in sects (Work Insects) and we Protest Ants (Protestants) need I define you?

Cool cause I got more men (Mormon) to prove Karmas a bitch and in the end (Indian) Karma is right behind you (U). Oh what? I know it sounds like a reach, but it is true because if youre indian then Karma is right youd be Hindu;

What we doubt the bars? Only reason I was Tsu “surfing” the heavens in that last line was to prove it dont take a trophy rapper to reach out to God. Aaaaaah.

Yall must think to sock a God MC is not in me? Until the god in me and this boxer speed get him rocked to sleep when I see niggas. I get it “shaking” you fucking with the greatest so if he dont show where the Cash is (Cassius) in (Clay) is where I leave (Ali) niggas. End this Christian with the Ba! Ba! Like his first name Ali nigga!

Im a beast nigga, I eat niggas. Im a cannibal in sync with Animal instincts. I “Complex bars” to “break niggas” So you dealing with a Cannibal in sync with animal instincts and Im a Precinct. “Lights Out”.

Cause when IBattle I Bangz with the Can like “Get em a fucking Sod….Blaow! This dirty pop have em looking like he dancing with NSync Im nice.

God is Good….(Crowd: All the Time) So see what makes you think we need to have you here to remind us of what the Savior could? How about you remind everybody here that youre a part of the biggest Mob in the world and that Bible got more bodies on it than any dirty pistol in any one of my niggas neighborhoods.

You know what the crazy shit is? Last time I battled a white boy worth mentioning he practiced Atheism. I told him he was the same as Christians.

Another man corrupted by a butt fucking lame conviction, plagued with Pagan and plagiarism used to control and help him cope with the way he living. Say it isnt? Next round not only am I going to state specifics Im a make it vivid, go ahead with ya little criticism about my career and ya Saint flips nigga.

Can I switch it up a little this rd.? Yall cool with that? Good! Cuz in my preparation for Mic

*Slogan*

That was pretty nice kid. But let me show you how to damage the nicest. Through channeling vices.

Most celebrated bible thumpers was later exposed as some sluts, like you about to be. Out here trying to get a good hold of some nuts and he aint clamping them vice-grips.

Dont look at me King. Cause look too long and get his “Royalty Check” Im strapped with the tools and no “mechanical license”.

You know I remember back when I first witnessed that one round extended match between you and some other senseless act. And you mentioned that you got into rap to talk to nonbelievers and bridge the gap.

And in the very instance you spit that rap I genuinely commended that, but something didnt match so I listened back something missing scrap… I mean outside the fact hes Christian, raps. At home and on sight (site) shout out ya Journalist for that. He believes in scripture, but puts his ten percentage in it as; Faith in God but not in man, who inspired by God wrote the book from where he gets it at so….Out side of a couple Christ flips and the aforementioned facts…..whats so Christ Like about what this nigga yaps?

Is it the Self Proclaimed righteousness via passive, aggressive, ambiguous attacks? Or the fact he has yet to mention any Devine message given, or expressed suggestion on how we should be giving back? See now I gotta ask where your intentions at?

And how do you plan or intend to bridge the gap between this and that? When its pretty specific that in this extent of rap the jist is that you go tit for tat. Wits get matched by way of some pretty judgmental and offensive raps to win the match; lift his stats, get some scratch. And by doing so, the losing opponents opportunities are actually slimmed in fact, so Im saying where exactly is Gods gift in that? Im not implying Im confident that its nonexistent, but if so how do you plan to implement it skrap?

I dont think you got the answers Sway. So allow an Emcee with no gimmick to kick the facts. All my real niggas know we vent the violence to prevent the violence and that right there is Gods gift to rap. So dont come up here, lying in whos name you preaching ya false teachings like you came here to heal the streets with that. We are positive and negative by Gods design, and even He know where Im from just venting, rather than doing the shit is about as positive as niggas gonna be with rap, so bitch keep ya act.

Its like yall gas his bars cause he told you he works on behalf of the staff of God. And yall just believed it. Well he doesnt have to cuss in his bars. Not afraid to say he fears God, hes not a fraud just flawless, a marketing genius. How? If I didnt know no better Id think you think he getting phone calls with some fucking exclusive offers from Jesus.  It aint Sunday. If yall need to know more of the bible nigga, yall should just read it!

That mutha fucka aint stashed in the Vatican or with Smack and them all vaulted and secret. He aint Cortez. Just another Christian with an agenda hidden for attention to his name through a mission that for Centuries already been force fed.

See what A Wards using is better known as Consumer relation. A little marketing tactic, publicly owned, were hell say yall his brothers and sisters but really view you as consumer related. So he sat back, studied, and consumed the relation; same way Christian Pilgrims that was cruising them Slave Ships () that moved to the States did. Seeking to start a new civilization, they claimed theyd teach a new “civil” way to elude and portray that they cool with its Natives. And look who doing the same shit! Using his faith as a tool of invasion, borrowing another groups innovations in hopes the consumer relates so he can consume what they making.

But like most I see the Greed in you. Yea you been impatient. So allow this surgery I give you be inpatient. And all you fake teachers, preachers, doctors, polices, all involved; if I gotta come back and slaughter hogs Im a get this whole strip baking (bacon). Mack a mockery of mine Ill come back and kidnap your first born daughter dog for having my identity a lil mistaken (miss taken) bitch. Aint no way he can say he killing me, for the rest of his life hell view this battle as a Slim Shady inury, and embrace (Em, brace) the shit!

I figure since we here, lets have some dialogue/
Right now, I want to talk with Saint, later well get the Mic involved…
You see that Word Saint, holds a dear meaning to me, because I walk in light/
I too am considered a Saint, but we dont walk alike/
The Greek word is Hagios (HA GE OSE), Morally blameless, physically pure, sacred/
But first lets bring that to context before we got into more layers/
There is none without Sin, Thats why Christ came and in light, Scripture
Depicts him as Jesus of Nazareth (a Jew), Im not sure who that dude is in the White pictures/
But Ride with me. . . His death and resurrection became the atonement for our lives/
Therefore through Grace by Faith; we have hope that is in God/
So as I servant we are covered, weve been washed from the stains right/
So were called Christians And that is the definition of a Saint, Mic../
Now correct me if I aint right, I feel you telling God “this aint my cup a tea”
When he lookin back like it couldve been this…. Saint Mic up a T…
Now I wont sit up here and say youre lost;  Cuz I dont know you from Adam/
But it does seem were cut from different fabric, so I should probably show you the patterns/
Ever FELT you were Caught in (COTTON) a mess lets say the Rents due/
Its a tough(FLEECE) lease, you and roommate dont MESH and youre spent too/
You sat an (SATIN) thought about it, cuz you owe a band and Plug is getting a cut/
So (SEW) what he needll (NEEDLE) put you in the read (THREAD), unless you get to stitchin him up/
Yall wasnt listenin up!
…. Cuz some of yall looking at me like son thats whack!
But I said we cut from different Fabrics so you gon think its fire when I … (run that back)

*Runs back with emphasis on scheme*

Lets get to stitching him up!
I said wed get around to Mic Right?/
Well Im old school like Yak Baks and a Lite Brite/
If I wanted I could put you in this knapsack Night Night!/
So thank God Im a changed Man!
Cuz Grace is that Gap between Michael and this Stray Hand/
I dont play fam…
Its not fair to rappers/
Another REASON, I see you base (CUBASE) your LOGIC off being a PRO with TOOLS
but I can tell youre soft where (Software) it matters/
Who engineered you? If something this Foul Can reach the Top – think Julio Stretching/
Its nothing to Hit him High – thats Coolio Message/
When a Wolf in ya face, - it aint Rubio Pressin!/
This for every time a Mic issue, messed up anybodys Studio Session/
Move to the side, cuz we on Next/
They overhyped you like you GoRilla cuz you Beat on Chess/
Im not convinced, Yall can hashtag Rise of the Saint!/
But right, now you lookin 5ft 5 in the Paint! – Lord stop him, Ford Shopping Go Find an Escape/
Lets get rid of him, Death Certificate, just sign and then date/
A different breed of Killer, Use kindness and faith/
This battle bro, Plaxico, your shots were a Giant Mistake/
Stop the Gun Talkin, you Sons watching…. He gon mime what you say/
Tell your 4th Grader you love him, thats how a real man looks a 9 in the face/
*Slogan*

Jesus Christ, ya boy just doesnt get it. Broke em down, two rounds, he still trying to punch his lil heart out.  Got the nerve to stand here all poised in his position.  We all seek gain in the name, but to convince his niche hell tell you its just poison that Im spittin.  And maybe you right. Through all the damage Ive provided, it does seem like Im glamourizing violence but this aint me glamourizing this me getting the poison out my system.

Gods gift to man was free will. You know, choices and decisions. So whats worse. Me up here hypothetically enforcing my existence or you forcing his conviction? I mean all the theatrics, running back to ya man dapping, fake laughing for consensus yet the hardest thing to do for you Christians, is listening!

Initially, I comprehended ya mission was to fill us with hope. Show us how to follow the will of the G.O.A.T., put down the pills and the dope, not criticize and try to kill us with quotes, or did you forget God will judge us both?  Look how many people came here for ya show, and judging by ya battle with FMag before you speak Gods will, you will judge an ear studded nose…. Well thats not Christian like…

But it is his type. Pathetic! The source of your hunger…synthetic. And even my stomach will tell you the real source for hunger is pain. You in this shit for your benefit not his ya bitch and the proof is all in this pigeons name. You want an Award?

Well you gone have to get it like Tyson nigga lets get loose. I mean you do have some “nasty stuff” in them “sucky rounds” to be “white, shit”…In other words Anubis was clit, and you tit juice; and I dont think you want me to squeeze to get proof.

Fuck a Flanders. You softer than some girl butt. Cant handle the bars get curled up, from these “ten speeds” leave em “rotten” for the “cabbage” turn Kimzy into Kimchee.

Greed, sloth, pride, wrath, gluttony, lust, envy; theres seven deadly sins and at the least bitch I am three. Till I Die im a keep it “100” Im man of the “Century”.

Look at his face. He gone try to say he isnt bothered. But he is. Starting to realize the difference between his creator and his father. You get to ask God “What?” I gotta ask him “Why?” We say two different prayers, we are two different problems!

This “Man” up to “Bat” and, you niggas “Gotham”. I do what I want here, who finna stop him. You? Nigga stop it.

Ah shit. Im bout to make it hard for the world to defy me why, because 95 percent of you battle rap niggas a bunch of “bitches slapping bitches” around….Why are you trying to be the next Heidi Fliess (female Pimp)? I dont know. But pussy nigga if I find out you out here pitching Christian, flipping bitches, or slicing pies; I will make sure every D Boy in ya crew will get murdered quick to put the “tools to your servers” Im the IT Guy!

Yea Im the IT factor. I kill a clown (Killer Clown) “Pump” to a “Writer” mouth. “Horror Fiction” aint ya job homie. You know the movie “It” factored in a Killer clown, and since he was in fear in the end I switched gears and came with “eight arms” on me. Saint Mic, Only angel that can blaze you niggas yea Im strapped with the Saviors Sinner the wrath of God on me!

KC. Cuz ya family? Understandably.  But since yall locked in “A Ward” perhaps I should free you of some of the Insanity, I mean. Come to these pussies. Regardless of what he believes you can believe we dumpin. Im a MidWest Dickhead Cunt how could you not “see me coming”?

I dont care if we moving its Christmas, we smoking, Leftovers, nigga you cant rap better than me in nothing!

You softer than ya baby pictures. Yall know Greek Mythology? Who gives a fuck! One to his “Cap” make em “invisible” Im a make it “hard to see the God” like he Hades nigga. My left, Wyclef have a wack spiritual rapper running for Haiti nigga. We thrive when its beef youll die in the streets I ride with a piece (peace) you couldnt see (C) my “Class” in a Mercedes nigga.

**Missing Bars**

I will kill any that fight foul with me, wild as me? How is he? You deliver it quite cowardly Ill hit you in yo chest so hard it change the logo from die daily to die hourly.

Heavenly Father (Prayer) I have not come to challenge you but more so the institutions that you bounded to. I was told to not “shoot” the “messenger” so I bring no disrespect to the Father. I just want him to “shoot” this “message” to SAGA.  (click) BLAKA!

This part is the future:

You've been dying to battle me Danny, and it's been a long wait,
but you even look at me the wrong way and it's long blades.
See saw shank, there's no escaping this shit, it ain't Shawshank.
Now can you picture a way beyond these bars? Or is it all hate?

Desperado lawyer, my secret weapon gonna get our case.
Secret weapon, gun in a guitar case.
How we gonna deal with the shit I throw up at him?
[?] Howie Deal, hidden connections I invented that.

I'm on a level that you never knew,
see two dimensional rappers,
depending how it shapes up on paper can be acceptable
But 3D writers go so far in depth you can literally see what he says to you.
But I'm on a different level of writing, the fourth dimensional
Timing, it's too exceptional
I write shit you never do, some people said he's a one trick pony
Well I'm correcting you

Cause your lines gotta connect two points to be one dimensional,
you're not even that.
Die mentioning (dimensional) my name next to you
Cause it something you could never measure to

Get drugged within an inch of your life for acting all cocky
And every rapper in the world can get it
I'll get 'em all bodied to they all stop me
Why carve into his chest? For the autopsy

That's more good (morgue) news
but the coroner can't handle it another one.
You said I'm getting sloppy, I should've used a fucking gun
The cops get suspicious of what I've done
So I throw his body in the wood chipper...and let him blend in with the other ones

I'm changing the landscape Danny
Welcome to the golden age
If rap was so much better in the olden days
Then why is your favorite fucking rapper dumpster diving for my throwaways?

They're all trash and you wonder why your rep dying
You let Randy leave with the bills/Bills without a Jet flying
So fucking long he changed his rap name from T-Rex to Rex Ryan

But you kept trying convince us you were gang banging and block wars
Always have your word as proof, we need a lot more
You're Morgan Freeman, you narrate a story that is not yours
You've never been shot at, you've been shot towards
And we can see the difference
Those hand me down shoes you never fit in so boom
Yeah, Ah Di Boom, soon as you couldn't cry victim
You went to dry snitching to anybody who'd listen

And when they didn't, you wrote blogs instead
See I can tell you're an informant that talks to Feds
C.I. Intel you're an informant that talks to Feds
You're just a rat searching for words to help the pigs
Fuck is this? Charlotte's Web?

You will burn/Wilburn and for no reason you let it transpire
I will torch your soul for our sins Dan Myers
One strike then you'll witness the matchbook backfire
Scorch in eternal flames underground with this shit
Blame the devil for the other two rounds of this shit

DANNY MYERS
I'll catch Gjonaj coming out his house with his whorish tramp
Put the double barrel on his eyes 'til he click the power forward, he's Horace Grant
I'll erase this bastard, that blast from the pump his face will splatter
You'll see a quarter slide away from this man like Jacob's Ladder

I caught his bitch, I cornered her
Sent her straight to the coroner
See didn't look like she was from round here, that's why I put four in her/foreigner

Two Mac 11's, two .45's, am I thugging?
That's been answered, I just hope these four arms ain't spotted like skin cancer

I'll slap the fuck out you
Bitch, I need a therapist
I'll write your grandma a "fuck you" note then have it translated in Arabic

Do you believe in a parallel universe? I do
The shit is insane, peep this
My daddy was in prison playing spades while I was working on my pen game

Danny's predictable, got a bunch of name flips for Gjonaj, don't I?
You figured I'd have a Joan of Arc bar, don't lie
I'll catch you in the twilight then zone
I'm a monster on this plain
No one believes you though you see it with your own eye (Gjonaj)

I keep a K in hand just to remind you not to play with Dan.
The chopper will flip your V sideways to show you I'm greater than.

Any normal beef I'm in, the fifth get pulled
But for you? I'm on set phone with my contact in Istanbul
He's a professional at making muscles relax
He provided the materials used in a Brussels attack

But he missed his target, furthering the tensions you and I harbor
I'll pull a shotgun from a dead body and utilize armor
Your man was blown to pieces but you gon' die calmer,
my jacket colder than death, suicide bomber

Don't speak to me, bitch ass niggas, I beam frequently
When I sleep I don't see pictures I dream frequencies
I emerged from a dangerous hood a gifted spitter
Where crooked cops put they hands on a kid like Mystic River

Twisted niggas will snatch your mom, there's nothing around scarier
The instructions are simple, if she mock/mach me or sound bury her/barrier

You food to us, we gon' catch you and bash in your teeth
This meal is unhealthy but you savagely feast
I'll have some MS G's (MSG) spot you then clash in the streets,
then I'll make your whore moan/hormone just to add to the beef

But that's not even the G Mo. (GMO)
heater low run up and let the can flicker
All in his face with the Desert like, "What you saying nigga?" (sand nigga)

Fuck you start for?"
I like the art form on Bar Wars
But I didn't jump him cause what I'm building is off the wall like parkour

You must remind yourself, killing niggas is my signature
Even my autographs are a sign of death, my mind's a mess
All I think about is different ways of assaulting
Along with playing the race card and saying everything insulting

King Of The Dot, if y'all wanted to test my pen, y'all could've got the best with the flows.
Y'all could've matched me with Soul, Con' (Soul Khan), instead he'll see the specs on the nose
Your death will be cold

And you on the ground with this shit
This wack MC gotta another two rounds of this shit
Yikes!

Round 2
GJONAJ
You like those Arabic jokes huh?
Well Danny already has his foot in the grave, but in a plot twist I dug him out
Cause it's finally a Massacre in the Middle East, Americans give a fuck about.

While they genocide Christians, they're condemning a religion
While God is my witness, I must first own up to my sins to cast the first stone, Bar God

I'll kill him Sunday then ask for forgiveness
Does that make me a hypocrite?
B Dot said you got FedEx, well allow me to flip the shit
Cause if I go postal, shoot the messenger, but I didn't pay for the box I just delivered it

I'm sick enough to be admitted in a methadone clinic
But admit it, I could put on a clinic with my method
You either get it...or forget it

There's only so much you can try with logic
Then you switch to diagnostics to fiber optics
You read points, are you a Bar God or a false dying prophet?
If you ask me, you're scared to believe in anything so you die Agnostic

You got it backwards, you never read a good book and rely on technological advances
You're the same idiot praying for a tablet
It was written in stone and real soldiers know what a command meant (commandment)

Thou shall not worship a false idol
Only the Bible can rival the penmanship I've been blessed with
Every sentence, pen is effortless
Every battle I attack with a religious emphasis
Because while you were playing Sega I was reading Genesis

{Then the lights go out and the crowd loses their collective minds}

[Gjonaj]
You are not my nemesis
You are a narcissist, I am nepotist
You favor your fucking self, I favor my fucking family, it's all relative
I'm 'bout to open up a fucking museum with these skeletons

Danny, what did you tell your kids when you packed up and moved on 'em?
What about Vicky? Shell? Boom? It happens too often
Everyone close to you suffers, I'm through talking
You back stabbed everyone on Earth so I'm moonwalking

I said, did that upset you?
What about when you told Rex he died the same day as his nephew?
You sold your soul at that venue
You booked the battle, even paid for travel
You went on Smack/URL and it was a favor that they let you

How could anyone respect you?
Where is your honor?
Look how you treat your own children? All they see is a monster
If Danny wasn't battle rapping, he'd never see his daughters
Imagine, having to move to Boston just to see your father

That's the power
No, that's the power behind inner and outer
For you they let out a reaction, an outer reaction
But I make it hard for 'em to breathe
In the span of four bars they feel pride, shame, hate, love, they ran out of reactions
I know longer worry if I get a reaction
They're too paralyzed by emotion to give a reaction
I'm winning simply off of inner reaction within a reaction
Inner reaction within a reaction, it's bigger than rapping
Let him have his final thoughts
Cause martyrs die for a cause, you died for a cost

DANNY MYERS
Let me guess
You're a Christian Muslim
That shit is overblown
I'll slit your throat with a cross, how's that for religious overtones

This should've been spoken on but I'm amongst the furious crowd,
surrounded by abandoned buildings and AK bullets piercing the clouds.
A corrupt government and everything near me is wild.
Bitch I'm speaking through the eyes of a Syrian child.

I've been in war, way before you came across the border clown.
My pen has shown men how to blow up,
now I'm showing them that there's more to rounds/mortar rounds

The homie loaned me a used burner, he keep those thangs,
that bitch didn't come in its original case like pre-owned games.
When I stash the trey, you'll be cremated to ash today;
Once the Tom stay in his mouth the gun is then Cast Away

Get your focus right.
I'll poke this knife til he's a poltergeist.
You better seek shelter in Detroit like Eminem at an open mic

You're a joke, nobody believes you're out here clapping toys
You just a bitch nigga that talks to his co-workers in his rapping voice

I didn't have a choice
I ran with niggas who put niggas in the soil for me,
while you out here betting on battles with mommy and daddy's oil money

But you know the drill.
I keep fire, you can't peep Myers.
Why the fuck would y'all put the God of bar fest versus a weak writer?
I'll drive down the block looking for you, I'll spot you,
jump out, cross and sweep, that's the most basic combo in Street Fighter

But we got a lot in common, like the shit we rap about
We got a tainted mind
We sit down and paint a rhyme to express all the pain inside
But y'all notice something? Those bars? That aggression?
Ain't it mine?
Now I must kill my own creation, I'm Victor Frankenstein

You picked a dangerous time, the wrong nigga to offer the cal'
I'll punch you with the adrenaline a mother uses to lift a car off of her child
You know how somebody been dead for six minutes
And surgeons are working through a blood puddle with speed?
And then resuscitated and the first thing someone ask him is "What did you see?"

Well what if it's me?
Adored in reaper's cloth,
I'll feed your thoughts that were written in the lost pages like the beepers off.

It gets deeper boss
I can't promise I will not hurt you
You just a fake mark in this field
You like a crop circle, you the jealous type
Upset that my style will beat ya
Red dots will leave spots in his scalp like Alopecia.

The devil disguises himself as your friend.
You don't even know you got the beast with you.
Niggas be walking with the pitchfork in they circle like the peace symbol.

I leave him buried in his own backyard, I got the Glocks cocked
Two bad bitches will fuck up his house like knock knock

Albanian composer; Simon Gjonaj
Does that, ring a bell to you?
Well it should, you fucking stole his identity
But what you failed to do was recreate his greatness

I got to hunt these villains
I'm giving you death out of compassion, it's like a mercy killing
First we peeling the skin off his bitch, then let the gat burst
My German dog will hit the leek with me and do his brat worse
We clap first
And he on the ground with this shit
This wack MC got a whole 'nother round of this shit
Yikes!

Round 3
GJONAJ
Now I'ma take you to the past

Said fans bagged to me slaughter names
Bagged, as in cold bodies that hand out when you wanted change
These rappers are all the same
Just empty fucking vessels that lack something
So they substitute substance with bad punches and I don't owe you a fucking thing
I'm what you had coming
But it's easy to give up everything when you have nothing

I hate the fucking expression "nothing to lose"
Is it priceless or worthless? I guess it's up to the view
See destroying your life was just something to do
But it's all sentimental, it only means something to you

I'm the black cloud on a perfect day with enough rain to drown you with
But I'm also the perfect day that surrounded it
The full map of a grand design
Just an idea trapped in a mind I can't fucking die
You don't think I've tried?
Yesterday I jumped off a fucking cliff and found out I could fly
I played Russian Roulette with a full clip and survived

I only left you alive just to suffer through the last one
A calculated risk, none of this is random
You're who the weak run to, I'm who they ran from
The people who hate my voice, don't even fucking have one

Get mutilated
Picture me stabbing a helpless victim or the hatchet hacking into him like an algorithm

A clear cut code of my own design
A basic operation where patients are prone to die
Cause I'm a neurosurgeon, I can only work with an open mind
And that's why...
An open mind, I mean try something you gon' see the other side

And that's why, in less time I'm better than you
You made a couple bad choices, I had nothing better to do than put the metal to you
Twin deuce deuces, what a catch 22

I said it's me versus you Danny
Did it really matter what league we battle on?

Sometimes you gotta take an extra step to decide what path you're on
But be careful who you step to
If you can't step up then step down and stay alive
You thought you would've stepped forward but really you were just an extra step to the side

My, how quickly Psycoses/psychosis passed then reality set in before the time stopped
Paul Pierce, the truth is, sometimes you gotta take a step back for the right shot

You were in the right spot Danny, but you picked the wrong time
So it's you I gotta cut in front of everyone to skip a long line

I'm not waiting, you should've never crossed my path Myers
You knew it would get bad Myers
I didn't want to have to bag Myers
But they told me I had to kill any and every one that admires/Myers

So I had to add Myers as part of my dark plan
And by the off chance you survive, I'm shooting with my off hand
Word to every fucking freckle you got, you've been a marked man

DANNY MYERS
You are fucking wack
I hope the fans had enough of you yet
Bitch, I can't die either
Just standing on my front porch is Russian Roulette

I wanna beat the shit out you
You know how someone been owing you money for like three months
Every time you see him he ain't got it
Then one day you just so happen to catch him and he out shopping?
That's when it's no longer about the money
This is easily comprehensible
Sometimes you just gotta whoop a nigga ass on principle

Bitch, I will Canelo Alvarez, right hand your soul in honor together
Along with a couple moves I stole from Conor Mcgregor
I lived in Detroit for years, on the west side, Dexter and Davison
I know niggas in Brightmoor and Inkster
I suggest you don't play with them
I freestyle battled Swan, was cool with the Dreadnaughtz
I ain't trying to exploit shit
But I ain't finna sit here and let a fake nigga tell me about some Detroit shit

Pussy
I brought a knife for you
The Glock burst for his brother
Gjonaj will be next to the blade like a Clockwork Orange cover

Elbow, right hook, then catch this knee it'll leak ya
Y'all ain't seen an Arab pussy get beat like this since Mia Khalifa

See me with a sweeper, fuck yo' album, they half do it
When this MPC/see him I ain't gotta hear this Araabmuzik
This is all cerebral, a mental challenge that I have sworn to win
Fuck your religious angles, Jesus you're not battling Born again

This is me at 20%, these bars you couldn't handle fully
Hoe, a Christmas caroler couldn't hold a candle to me
I ran with bullies that'll put you on camera, don't become viral
Free Ah Di Boom cause I still rock with Jersey like Gun Titles
I'm unrivaled, absolute power, unbridled
Dumb Kyle will get shot at until it becomes idle
On my end, you'll get hit in the head with a sun dial
There gun fire before cops are called and your son dials

I'll kidnap your wife and your kid
They both part of a lesson
I gotta do this to 'em cause you both saw that aggression
I'll hold him to a fifth story window
Once the kids out the mom gon' go through it, that's postpartum depression

When they cheer for me, it gives me an energy beyond Myers
The crowd just adds to the heat, it's like a bonfire
If I ain't got the 4-5 or 12 gauge, the chopper suffice
This machine will tell you whether/weather we cool or not like a Doppler device

You can get it to advance warfare, the Tec gon' shoot,
tap his ex twice, she fly across the room, she got the exo suit.
Shawn Morrison writes half your shit
Behind the scenes he puts the time in
You just play the role as the Gunman behind Shawn pen/Sean Penn.

I'll walk up on him, won't say a word, then the toast lifting ya,
this silencer conversates with the dead it's like a ghost whisperer.
I'm outta here.
What's the difference between a whisper and a scream when they're both done out of fear?
I'll pull the trigger under your chin, all out in public,
put your thoughts in the sky you can think with cloudy judgement.
For the last years, I've been at every stage and I smoke writers,
and tell Hollow Da Don, "you gotta see me for that G.O.A.T. title."
And he on the ground with this shit
Thank the Lord he ain't got another round of this shit
Yikes!

Between battling at BlackOut or in Cali, this could only be in one place.
So I’ma beam you up; I hope your son can read the updates.
I knew you’d get your second chance to meet with Jesus some way,
but you hadn’t crossed me yet, so why would I go east to son Day(Easter Sunday)?

The floodgates are open; better flee that ship.
Everyone I’m with(-)draw, like a rehab stint.
No cheap antics, just rap from me; that’s it.
Three rounds in your face, on some ski mask shit.

You ain’t never been served like this,
and I put every single word I spit on Irvine Crip.

Sight locked on my target; they brought y’all a marksman.
I’m perched up at Lee Harvey Oswald’s apartment.
They said I can’t punch with him, but if I knock off his jaw, then
he gon’ hear me break it in like the watchdog is barking.
I’ll shut Day’s clock off so it’s not so alarming,
when I stop Spawn from starting like I shot Todd McFarlane.

Fuck it; I’m in monster mode. Card shark; the water’s cold.
Wash and fold Day like I got the day off: office closed.
I’ve got it locked. Player one, let the cartridge load,
game on, I’ll catch thirty to life like the Contra code.

Try me. I’ll show up to son’s front porch, and
put rounds on the house like I just uncorked it.
My right’s so well-known I got a plus one for it,
to drop Lyt(light) all night. I don’t think son(sun)’s up for it.

Of course there’d be a chance he came with antics; Day’s an anarchist.
But if he did, then shit, I got one too. Get Day an ambulance.
He been dead since the day that Day was handed this.
Now, give Day a hand, and pay the data analyst
it’s gonna take for Day to handle this.

Half your battles, you’re the dopest rapper that I’ve seen.
The other half, you do shit that’s a cancer to the scene.

So keep that shit in mind next time you get all costumed up:
what Lyt does outside the West still reflects on all of us.

DAYLYT
Personally, I believe no battle rapper is perfect. We all did some damage.
We all done put people in a situation where they get to cheer,
and some where y’all get to panic.
I done created so many people in my head, people may call it genius,
and some may say it’s what they call schizophrenic.
I’d like to sacrifice this first round just to talk to my antics.

I look all my fans in the eyes and say I’m sorry for the P. Diddy blog.
I’m sorry for the gay shit.
I’m sorry for losing the title shot; I’m sorry for the slave fit.

I’m sorry for walking out on Rone; that shit was bad for my damn health,
and to show y’all how sorry I am for the Loe Pesci battle,
I’m about to wipe ball sweat on my damn self.

But wait, y’all didn’t get the elbow.
I didn’t wipe ball sweat on my face ‘cause I had doubts to blow up.
I wiped ball sweat on my face ‘cause I’m about to go nuts.

I been living in a dope situation, and it’s not a crack house.
I’m back ‘cause I got to wig on these college kids;
start bucking inside their frat mouth.
The “keep it going” style was colder than Big Shirley, but surely,
niggas put their hands on the flow(floor) like they tried to tap out.
Pussy fight: let me see what these cats ‘bout.
It’s a campout: I’ll send him fire. It’ll be the same enemy as taking the bat route.
Think Bane: these mouth bars, they got to face it.
Fact, they Draked it. They sent us back to Back to the Basics,
but yet I’ll still fitting to Black(-)Out.

Why do they book gods versus these baby fruit flies?
And I get to burying maggots.
I’ll put him underground for free like Harriet traffic.
Get planted soon as they told you they would let us(lettuce) in the ring,
and soon to find out he married a cabbage.
What, y’all ain’t get it? I’ll leave his wife vegetable.
We set fire to any female carrying static.
That’s the price you got to pay for being the wife of an aryan faggot.
These words is stone like the Sumerian tablets.
I’ll put holmes in a hole, like damn, he a rabbit.
Fuck what you done. Give your crew tons(croutons);
leave them all vegetable. They can be a salad.
The land we abandon. Hand me a band and
I’ll go for the steal, like damn, he a bandit.
The best Day. You couldn’t rest Day if you hand me the sabbath.
You would(wood) handle me; if you can, be a cabinet.
Metal arms to his top: man see the Gadget.
I was the first on Earth saying(saiyan) shit like this.
Damn, he the raddest(Raditz).
The plan be the stratosphere in here with the—
(time called)

Round Two
THE SAURUS
You ‘bout to get everybody in your pod casted. I am a Dirt.
You’ll get hit with everything, from nines to fives. I am a work.
I’ll leave you neck-less(necklace); I’ll put my Life on that. I am Alert.
You can feel it in your chest, I got this body covered. I am a shirt.

Yo, Day, how come lately you’ve been lazier with your writing than ever?
I got something hot(-)headed your way. I am a temper.
You said, “I am a looper”, “I am a worm”, “I am the Bart”, “I am a render.”
Come on, man. You used to be way better than this. I am remember.

Pretend you’re a grown man; your word’s worth more than weight.
This ain’t a turf war with great, but I’ll turn Norman Bates.
I got a dozen extra rounds I’m too dirt poor to waste,
and got away with murder after the first four D ate(First 48).

That shit is so easy to do, I wrote this one round for you, dog.
The metal I bring to the table leaves you spun ‘round: that’s foosball.
This Kombat will chop cats; I’ll Kung Lao your roof off.
How can we trust Daylyt when son(sun) down to moon y’all?

Now, I got something cold in the chamber: cryogenically.
Agent K: I’ll flash on Day and wipe y’all’s memory.
I don’t need shine, so why the fuck is Lyt(light) on next to me?
What the fuck’s a Day got to a lifelong legacy?

Nothing. I’m getting gold, closing the loop.
Uppercut: skylight. Put a hole in your roof.
I was gonna talk about all of the accomplishments that you’ve blown playing hoops,
but I didn’t want this round to start getting emotional. Oops(Ooops).

Now you know that you can’t dodge your punishment and payback.
You want to blow someday? Well, Puffy can arrange that.
Your pen’s more shaky than the one that did your face tat.
I’ll catch a case over this like a Money in the Bank match.

DAYLYT
At one point in time, niggas used to think the Earth was flat, until Columbus came.
Y’all let a mass murderer tell y’all anything, and y’all believe it.
In the end(Indian), he left everybody dead, cold blooded,
and that’s when the game got anemic,

‘cause the white sails(cells) went sky-high.
You folks left the glue coast(glucose), and I got to free these niggas.
First shot from the index, then blood spill;
whoever’s gonna die ‘a be these(diabetes) niggas,

thinking life too sweet.
The pencil insulin fight dude. I ain’t the type to(two) text a nigga.
Organik pack the card and I deads a nigga.
Everybody get chewed: Hannibal Lecter nigga.
I Do this write(Right) Thing: I’m Spike Lee;
Nike: every step, I got to check them niggas.
You come in testing(intestine) me, but I can’t stomach their lines.
I got a gut feeling I’m ‘bout to wreck them(rectum) niggas.

You gassed, trick(gastric). Fuck around and get bypassed if I pass you by.
They asked you try to be tier(tear), and you just end up being the last who cry.
My big homie say,
“fuck the money. Take every opportunity you get, ‘cause this life’ll pass you by.”
I’m from the era where you had to go nuts.
It ain’t matter how much cash you(cashew) got.

All men(almond) get snapped on. The deacon peeking (pecan),
but they’ll depict the killers.
In Watts, they was raising(raisin) nuts. Soon as I hopped on the trail, mixing niggas.

To get to the top action, we see niggas like TheSaurus, we not rapping.
We give them the best mouth beat in the world: Scott Jackson.

But I been wigging since a youngster, O.J. Mayo type.
Mayo white, but I black the Bayo type.
Fifty cents(50 Cent), we wave hands in his face: Tony Yayo night.
I prey your type. Harder to slash at you: Halo knife.
So many guns, nigga, this shit gon’ look like a Halo fight.
Think Day go light, I snap on these squares perfect; nigga, I’m Lego nice.
You wouldn’t get a piece of this small round with a Bagel Bite.

Day gon’ fight. Two shots, just body. The lower half, still there; the top half, real flat.
Before the shot, Pat Stay. After the shot, Illmac.

I’m back. I’m back. You feel the spine,
but before I go in, Malathion, time? (Time.)

Round Three
THE SAURUS
That Solomon battle was weird.
I Remember the Time when you said you wanted to Make a Change,
and right then, the example was clear.
That match was reflective of Michael Jackson’s career:
nothing Black or White, just standing there
watching something so bad from The Man In the Mirror.

You think you bodied Iron, but listen. That’s something I’d like to revisit.
The irony is that your ego’s so easily bruised because Lyt’s really iron deficient.
But now Day thinks he’s gonna son me, like I am the infant?
I’ll take flight on Daylyt like sky is the limit.

In a minute, the game’s changing. I’m fitting to body: waist training.
Son(sun) facing the crack of don(dawn); now Day breaking.

I ain’t got to try hard. Yeah, I got some light(Lyt) bars,
but in one shift, I’ll punch into Day like a timecard.

Clock it. Try not to misuse your minutes, or this dude is finished.
Just stick to your gimmicks. Your fucking tattoo looks like shit, dude, admit it.
You are Spawn from the comics: you’ve got issues with Image.

I’m sick of all the extra shit, though. It’s sad ‘cause you’re way talented,
but the example that you set as a man? Well, I ain’t down with it.
Tell me, a decade from now, you gonna act like you ain’t proud of it
when you ask your son how he did on his SATs
and he says he antic’ed his way out of it?

I knew it was a risk, but this battle was me taking my own chances,
so when they ask why, I’ll say the same thing I told ‘ganik.
Day could be the best in the game if he goes back
to the way that he rapped before all the fame had him so famished.
Now he looks for any card he can play and he goes Gambit,
but he ain’t even notice his ace in the hole vanished.
Every match, you should show up in the same thing you rocked against Pat
when you went for the chain, ‘cause you’re a slave to your own antics.

DAYLYT
Third round is when I let the heat blow fast.
Organik, you stop me time this time, I’ma beat yo ass.

We could’ve had a hardwood classic,
a throwback: old jersey, sure(Jersey Shore), but I don’t rock with Snooki.
This when I got to tuck the lead for these knuckleheads,
but I ain’t forgot the noogie.
A three-round barfest, yes, but this is when I got to stop the goodie,
‘cause when I look at your face, all I can remember is
when Locksmith said you look like a Chewbacca woodie.
You looked at me and said, “mmmm,” and did this awkward boogie.

But that’s back when you and Okwerdz was popping,
and the top of the hip hop was true.
The leaders of the backpackers,
telling the world a Smack rapper is what not to do.

I remember they followed you. I read my Locksmith comments,
like “this wack Smack rapper.” That shit left me with hurt pride,
knowing I was the only street rapper in G.T.,
and y’all labeled me one of the worst guys,
but yet the worst ride from first prize:
the same niggas who had multis now all rap about how they gon’ hurt guys.
Facts. I just seen a battle where Reverse Live said, “I’ma squirt nines.”

Had me like, “are you serious?” But that’s what your people do.
Y’all make the world hate us for something we do,
then y’all do it and make it look cool.

That’s when the plan unfold.
Prime example: Sir Mix-a-Lot video, “ew, Becky, look at her butt.”
Now every white bitch want to look like Amber Rose.

Nigga, we created everything, but y’all take it, and leave us demanding for respect.
Speaking of Amber Rose,
I would give you white bitches the finger, but(t), Organik cut my check.

I should go for the mark-out, but all they gon’ say is, “how come I’m testing you”.
This shit about to Okwerdz,
‘cause it’s fitting to be a one-rhyming, gun-lining punchline festival.

If it’s a party, hand me my grand baggy grab bag.
They told me Ron died, I was mad Caddy fast passed.
The hand scrammy blam blam, shoot his granddaddy grand dad,
two fives on side his face: naa nanny naa naa.

It's the most underrated. Underhanded, I oversaw,
‘cause being overlooked creates a pen that's over all.
It's a love/hate relationship with the crowd. I know it's wrong,
but it's just a troll to control the fans, so all in all,
this is a helping hand to bring strength to a cast that I seen would break all along.

Listen to me Corey. I mean, basically what I'm saying is, you're the weakest link.
Oh, what? What y’all think, he fire?
'Til I roll up in this joint like E-Z Widers
going overboard to air you through the tube like deep sea divers.

Wait a minute. Who the fuck y'all thought I was battling, Darrell?
Oh, so what, y'all think he liver?
Mind of a serial killer,
I've been aiming to put an Arsonal in the trunk: I'm the D.C. sniper.
Wait a minute. What else rhymes with "the D.C. Sniper"? B.E.T. Cipher.
So, wait a minute. You won each week and so what? Now y'all think he liver?
Dios mio, in the spirit of Chris Rios, he speaks nada.
I'm a beast, woken up out his deep sleep, fire in his eyes.
I'm alive, and you gon' greet me sire, or you'll meet messiah.
These sixteens get put to rest for trying to sleep with tiger(Tyga)s.

Reality shows he's not a threat; dog’s a liar.
You pulling straps out and marking dudes in battles with no thoughts inspired,
doing dumb, dickhead, white boy shit, and that'll get your jaw rewired.
I wish you would(wood) spark.
I'm from the jungle, so if the heat wave it's cause the four is(forest) fire.

It's a wrap if we talking that loud. Meet Meek,
I'm in the trap, drilling over the base(bass) like Chief Keef.
Head shot - bang. Brains on the horn - beep, beep,
‘cause ain't no seeing Cort’(court): cheap seats.

I can out rap all you chumps. All you front, then all you slumped.
Brooklyn, that's where Cor' is from,
with a dummy waiting to bust(bus) a whole clip like Forest Gump.

It's time that I black out; you lack props.
What y'all did, wave a steak right in front of a have-not?
Think, a disguise on Cort’(court) ain't a mascot,
and since y'all pushing buttons, it's only right I turn Blackout into Black Ops.

‘Cause I control the game; no, scratch that.
I control the game; I'll school you Corey.
Look, don't love 'em, just fuck 'em. Just fuck 'em and leave 'em,
don't hug 'em and squeeze 'em,
but, when it come to the bitches, we can tell the honeys mislead him.
Aw, man. Your stats dropped; you're a bad cop because you cuff for no reason.

As far as Black Entertainment Television goes as a whole,
well, bro, they disrespected you.
Plus Arsonal mushed you in your face; Pat Stay damn near molested you.

So what’d you do? You whined and complained, and that's why son getting dealt.
You came back to the States trying to rep Grapes and fuck with the belt.
Then K-Shine's palm proved them punches in the ring did nothing to help,
so how can a country stand behind a man
who doesn't have the balls to stand up for himself?

You mean to tell me you won on national television and didn't even have a contact?
You're white, and you're privileged.
Your rich ass daddy ain't teach you nothing about a contract?

Nonsense. He doesn't know about fine prints?
Fine, bitch. Your death certificate is getting signed, stitched,

and I sense the hatred. It's great, kid; I'm ceasing the weak.
Body language, obituaries: you can read it, then weep.

And like I said, I appreciate y'all reaching out,
but wait 'til round three, there's some shit we gotta speak about.

CHARRON
Hat's off to my last opponent,
but I ain't come here to make excuses or rap some bullshit.
See, when I deal with the smack, I stood there insulted;
when you deal with the Smack, the footage gets vaulted.

URL knows you're a bird; they don't upload your battles.
They vault your(vulture) footage like the Discovery Channel.

You rap 'bout pushing work and how you scheming crazy.
I'll rap 'bout it too, even if the people hate me.
Putting ops on payroll, even the police will pay me.
I got cops dropping kis(keys) off in my room like Steven Avery.

But that ain't me. I'm reserved, polite and ain't good in fights.
I keep it a hundred, like Cortez's booking price.

But wait, you're top tier? Your battles are fucking torture.
The day you're top tier is the day you jump the border
in a shirt that says "proud Trump supporter”.

Your girl's pussy was lose; she had to start to give dome.
That girl gargled Charron. She was choking so hard she pulled out Arsonal's phone.

But I didn't want Coytez. I want to body Tay.
No Jay Hova, but I'll Takeover when I put Roc(-)away.
I've seen the way you do it, and it's not the same.
They gon' feel the pressure on cam(Cam) and see him drop the ball;
this is how the Broncos play.
I'll break him down; you won't want to play.
I'll have you feeling like Meek Mill on Boxing Day.
Your slogan is “top tier money”. You do not get paid.
Who thinks he gets that Lux, Mook and Hollow pay?
You lie like a politician 'bout your top tier pay.
It ain't true dough, you talking about the side of your mouth like Jean Chrétien.

Caustic exposed he couldn't smash ‘cause he was limp.
Listen, penis shrimp, you shouldn't have dissed Bruce B, you bitch,
but the theme of the needle fits, ‘cause you have such a needle dick,
when you beat a chick it's considered an intravenous hit.

His favorite band? Limp Bizkit. But I'll cut it out quick.
You can't tell jokes, you have to act tough when you spit.
I dare you to shoot me; I’ll just rebuttal that shit.

So let me guess, if someone put hands on you, you gon' fight.
I'm laughing at this situation, it's so light.
Since birth, I've been pushed into lockers and hit with cold rights.
I should be running the Ultimate Rap League,
because I've been getting Smacked my whole life.

Round Two
CORTEZ
This is how his first round sounded.
"I'm in an aggressive mood, when I sketch in you, then I step to you, like Tekken—“
Yo, why the fuck do you rap like that?
I guess y'all figured this would be a waste of a round,
and that would be perhaps why y'all would think I would slack like that,
but it's not in my DNA, so I'm gonna separate you from the gap like that,
and the last time here I cook 'cane, so it's only right I come back like crack.

Now my name at one point was right here; it don't get no higher, cuz.
Y'all all thought I fell off and my career was nearly dying, cuz,
but now I'm back from the dead, it's the Lazarus Effect.
Y'all don't get it, y'all ain't even see me rising up
so wisen up, you idle up, you idol us,
or I'll surprise him out of nowhere with this gift like secret admirers.

I am(I.M.) just well-received like mobile phones,
grilling white boy in his mouth like Post Malone.
Whoa. It costs to be the boss and the throne's my home,
so if I let you get a(-)head, it's only so I can add it to my totem pole.

Whoa. The very second I'ma set it in action of every second I'm clapping,
you’ll get bucks after it fire; that's a severance package.

I came here for one reason: to stop the lesson.
In a class all by myself, yet it's not detention.
Hollow tips like Rone vers’ Pat Stay: these rounds is comple(i)menting,
with add-ons fully equipped. I hope you got your weapons,
techs(text) blue, get left red. Oh now you got the message,

and he's talking reckless. Fuck it, pass me the tool.
Stupid, clips on Cort(court) like Shaqtin’ a Fool.
Fuck it, I don't even need gun bars to beat him ’til my hands get a bruise.
The way I drug him over the border, he could pass for a mule.

Now let's take some things into account. Nevertheless,
I bring balance here, so go 'head and check. You're forever in debt.
Insufficient. I mean I can't get no lesser than this,
and though my name's on the card, I get no credit for this?

And that's why I need to know, who planted this fucking seed to grow?
‘Cause you? It's unbelievable how you achieve with style that's unbelievable.

I mean, Shotgun Suge tapped your pockets in front of Smack and them,
then K-Shine's palm put you right back on Smack again.

I mean, I ain't even mad that you got slapped, and that's a fact, ‘cause shit happens.
But I'm more mad at the fact that after you got slapped.. Bro, you kept rapping.

Plus DNA and K-Shine 3-0'd you. Both of y'all. You ain't learn your lesson by now?
I got a question for pal. How you come with 100 Bulletz, but ain't get you a round?

Wow. But I'ma save that for later; I appreciate y'all reaching out,
and round three’s next. There's some shit we gotta speak about.
(Out.)

CHARRON
This event is strictly for top tier. You gotta book them for their bars,
so you do have a secret admirer, ‘cause no one knows who put you on this card.

Yo, my hotel crazy. The squad gets savage.
Carter Deems jumping on the bed popping rachets
Your hotel don't even got a mattress.
All you have's a couch; Organik got you the Total Slaughter package.

But that's how Brooklyn do. Every time I look at you,
I see the couch you slept on after Rex started cooking you.

You came in last place. Everyone made mad cake.
You spent more time on the couch than the guy from Half Baked.

I saw your battle with Jimz, watched it on blu-ray.
You said, "I had to pop myself.” My TV paused for like two days.
Spit your gun bars; I ain't gon' lie 'bout how I gotta let my tool spray.
If I took a Shotty out, it's of retirement, to catch a body in the U.K.

You have a S.T.D., Cor’. Bet it's stressful to piss.
Now he picks up girls online at Plentyofitch.
A girl you smashed hit me up; I rejected her quick,
‘cause as soon as Cor' in her(coroner), I wouldn't be caught dead with that bitch.

This Canadian's so big, it might offend a Bender.
You died from Rex(wrecks); this is more than a fender bender.
They resurrected Ledger, the second Dexter,
Professor Lecter perfecting lectures in tracheotomies next semester,
my pen will enter this candy rapper 'til his neck's dismembered,
and something pops out his throat, now that's a 'Tez Dispenser.

But we could take this to the stage if you want war with Corey.
I'll have my whole team waiting at the border for me.
You won't see Lady Gaga in a hotel, but it'll get more than gory
when I bring killers to Cortez; that's an American Horror Story.

I hate when you tell the crowd what you're doing to make it look easy.
Funny you faced G.O.D. and 'Cane but ain't able(Abel) to beat me.
(Wordplay.)

But if I ain't down with you, I'll put the pound to you
and shoot everyone surrounding you.
(Aggression.)

Do you talk like that in real life?
He came up to me like, “I was with this girl last night. Her name was Jasmine.
I almost got it in, but I just couldn't make it happen.”
(Erectile dysfunction.)

But fuck the jokes. More gangster, monster. Grown man, Mossberg.
Desert Eagle; they call me The Bird Man.
I'm shooting with two hands, aiming on one knee; I aim at you, and hit the lady in 1D.
Those aren't my bars. I’m not even saying it right;
I'm just spitting a T-Rex mixtape verse before he does later tonight.

Round Three
CORTEZ
Now what more I got to do? I'm talking to you.
I haven't lost clearly in years, and yet I still get lost in the views,
and often I'm screwed, so I need y'all all to listen to these thoughts that I spew,
‘cause this wasn't a step down, it was a step-to, just so you can walk in my shoes.

Now, what, more, I gotta do? You should ask yourself, in fact,
because you’ve done a lot for King Of The Dot with unselfish acts,
but how can you separate from a league that always welcomes Pat
while you're always left out in the cold and being stepped over as a welcome mat?
I can help with that.

First off, grow a fucking set of balls. Second off, grow a fucking spine.
Third, be a fucking man, start fighting back.
‘Cause how the fuck you chase a chain for five years,
and let a nigga change your third round and you ain't fight for that?
I mean, despite the fact you spent weeks and days writing raps,
all you did was prove you been a slave to the chain way before Daylyt and Pat.

Hold on.
You chased the fucking chain, for what? Five years?
“Wahh, Pat made me change my third,” and you cried tears?

What happened to all that Grape Street cripping, cuz?
Yo, that's how you know, look at the bullshit we allow.
There's a big difference between you fucking spitting in a round
and him fucking spitting and punching you in a round.

I mean, you represent everything I see wrong with battle rap today
You pull out straps like it's a joke, purple flags like that's live;
it's bad vibes, Corey, it's sad, why?
‘Cause you're not a black guy, you're a black eye.

Always looking for shock value. It's unlikely that you like me, pal.
Shock value, God literally wants to strike me now,
‘cause I catch bodies after bodies, you see, my life be foul.
That's why I'm taxing and getting checks to put a soul(sole) in a bag like Nike Town.

Hold on. Think about that, that shit's deep.
But what the fuck you gon' do, huh?
With your Mayweather promotions.. let the fifth leak, you pipsqueak? Bitch, please.
You’d probably sell out your fam and send them up shit's creek for chips, B.
Wow, this bitch blew(blue) and turncoat quicker than Mystique. Bitch, please.

It's deja vu to me; no ski mask when I'm steeling you,
that Shotgun in his face: look at me when I'm killing you.

Just be yourself, Corey; those are words from the industry.
They all knew you couldn't work for me lyrically.
You're autistic, so how you getting checks at home but can't work this(dis-) ability?

As for me, I write from what the fuck I see; my view from the pits.
If the tool come equipped and I'm sealing your top, that means I'm roofing your shit.
So quit fucking fronting, ‘cause you won't buck for nothing: you're frugal as shit.
And if I scope him off the top, it's just my View From The Six.

Now, he said my battles went in the vault; damn right, I was wild thirst.
For y'all to see the footage, my style hurts, pound dirt,
so I'ma put Corey in the ground Earth,
just so the fans get to catch the body, it's like we crowd surf.

And, one more thing. Bro, you have really fucking bad luck with national television.
No, like, like, really fucking bad luck.
I mean, first you went on B.E.T. and they ain't cast your ass.
Last week, Canada A.M., they banned your ass.

But it's because everybody hypes him. Somebody must've gassed that hater,
‘cause still your bars been half-assed, playa.
You just bringing the city down with faulty lines like San Andreas.

I got a new slogan, bitch. Fuck you fakes, corny, keep doing what y'all do,
and stay the fuck away from me. Brooklyn all day. I keep it trill for that.
Lick a shot for PH, ‘cause the real is back.

CHARRON
Yeah, I did rap for 80-year-olds on TV. It's a bad look? You want to talk about it?
Half of them have Alzheimer’s; they've already forgot about it.

But I've been battling for seven years, still cashing checks.
The fans still love me; still get mad respect.
I snap your neck; I still spaz with vets.
K-Shine's hat.. still ain't landed yet.

But did Shine leave a mark? Hell no.
If I slap him, you'll really see prints(Prince) on Cort’(court) like the Chappelle show.

Me and 'Ganik are boys; he knows I'm the truth.
He'll say his dog ate this ese(essay) like a homework excuse.
The internet hates; it's what they constantly spew.
This ain't the last supper, don't whine(wine) when I give this body to you.
I'll burn Ernesto to ash; that's what they want me to do.
Ernesto starts with an Ern(urn) and I'll make sure he ends off in one too.

In Atlanta, you said you're dead broke. How is he a G?
You borrowed $300 from Sonny, not for his kid he needs to feed,
it was so you could buy an outfit to look fly on B.E.T.

That's what you think about when you're getting your bread?
What about making sure your son is eventually fed?
I guess them Instagram likes are better instead.
I let the Shine get to my cheek; you let the shine get to your head.

How are you in your thirties and have no wealth?
How do you not feed your kid like he has no mouth?
And you say I'm not a man ‘cause I didn't scrap myself?
If I bought outfits instead of child support, I would slap myself.

Image, street cred - that's what you preach about.
When I have a son, work ethic, education - that's what I'll teach about.
My son will be at his graduation and thank me for reaching out,
while your son's on welfare like, "There's some shit we got to speak about.”

But yo, I was reviewing your little street code, let me get my facts right.
If someone slaps you, you supposed to hit them back right?
And if someone jumps your boy, on sight you get their back right?
Well, ain't this the first time you been around Dizaster since the Math fight?

I thought you'd be showing up ready to spaz in a ski mask
You should've put Dizaster underground like the Cassidy rematch

Right now, Math calling like, "You ain't got balls like that.
Dizaster right there. Why ain't you tap his jaw like that?
That's why Smack put you in the vault like that."
You apologize for being a hoe, Math hung up and you called right back.

You are clearly not a top tier, buddy.
Look at those teeth; you're doing top tier gummies.
There's a reason you're broke and don't have top tier money;
it’s ‘cause no one in the world thinks you're top tier, dummy.

So it don't matter if you think I'm a bottom tier cracker,
as long as I keep killing Smack's bottom tier rappers.

I put the beam on these self righteous niggas; fuck B Dot.
You'll think this nigga changed his name the way he'll see(C) dots.

Nah, fuck these gun bars; I ain't come here to spark this nigga.
When you in front of a false prophet, you supposed to talk to niggas.

Don't you run with Brother Polite, a ignorant nigga who promotes polygamy?
How you gon’ lead us when you a slave to another man's bigotry?

Peep the imagery: a fake nigga, posing as a damn leader,
versus Black Jesus, that could turn water to Sangria.
You don't want it with these bars. You don't want it with these hands either;
I’ll bet he break up after the first land like Pangea.

You come across as a social political activist,
but you just using rap to tap into niggas’ pockets likes Aktive is.

I ain't gon' lie, that shit you be talking sound good; you be preaching, Dot,
but I brainstormed under my mental umbrella. You be reaching, Dot.

You trying to force feed us your views on right and wrong through writing songs,
but in October, ReeCee went to the Million Man March, and you didn't ride along.

See, this first round, I'll counteract the key to your plan,
but by the third(,) I(eye)’ll put one in your Pineal gland.

You battled Fiji, Stricc, a freestyle Daylyt, now you facing D. Myers.
You finally stepped up to a plus(A+); now we'll see where B mind is(B-).

Your neck, that's just something for me to hack at.
For these Dead Presidents, I'll leave this preacher’s head in a backpack.

You want this crown of the west? Here, nigga, put on both of my shoes.
You ever been to New York, in front of a thousand niggas hoping you lose?

You ever defend this coast to the point you’d let a gat blast?
It’s funny how you talk all this slave shit, but I'm the one taking the backlash.

I got on a Dallas Stars hockey jacket, banana clip tucked. I'm 'bout to jugg his ass.
You'll see the crescent moon come from under the star like the Muslim flag.

I laid the Blueprint for the west, but he is an offender clearly.
This gun is the schematics to leave any nigga injured near(engineer) me.

You can't even trust the niggas that follow you;
that's what Jesus’ apostles proved.
I'm over top of you, Aristotle view;
the Choppa fuse his molecules with fossil fuels.

I'm confused; this not for views. Let's rationalize, B.
Anytime you writing(,) god, you supposed to capitalize(,) G.

Sonic Soundwaveus gave me game; he said, “nigga, fuck a metaphor.”
Now I'm in the hood, riding with a panther like Skeletor.

Charles Burnley, I ain't wanna get these guns involved,
but if I meet you at the Crossroads, your nephew’ll be missing his uncle Charles.

They crazy if they think I ain’t a legend;
they even use my age as reference.
This is facial recognition technology on a ancient weapon;
it'll give his chin a new identity like a Asian wedding.

I won't come at you with a mob of niggas; it'll be me, two or just three.
In case them cells see us(Celsius), you gotta keep a small circle, to a degree.

And even though he already on the ground with this shit,
this wack emcee got another two rounds of this shit.
Yikes!

B DOT
Black, African power. But I see all skin folk ain’t your kinfolk,
and by the looks of things current, see, it’s all about currency;
these mental slaves want me to pay, but these chains on my brain been broke.
I came in this game for change. Look, Danny, I knew what I was in fo’
giving up this type info; I knew these lames’d want to tear down my frame,
but as long as they saw that picture, that’s really all I was pic(k)ed fo’.
Now these rounds is a breath of fresh air like Mentos;
after me, there’ll be no others to do what I did, though.
I broke bread with sinners, had dinners where men toast,
brag, boast about whose toast shot men most.
I said fuck all that jargon; I’m not here to trade bars and bargain
with politicians just to win votes.
This arc of this new covenant; it been dope from the get-go,
but the BarGod gon’ try to flood us with stories. All mythos.
Well tell him I’m Christlike,
meaning I walk right(write) on water: everything come out that pen floats.
I been dope, before my battle with Fiji or Stricc, bro.
My people see me as a reincarnation of the Pharaoh Ahmose,
running out this hyksos,
and I know you niggas don’t read the glyphs, though,
but I went back, did the research, delved in feet first,
read script slow, then brought y’all the Cliff notes.
Planting seeds in y’all mind, even if you don’t find what I spit dope,
that’s fine; I sense the shit,
so it’s photosynthesis how son(sun) shine and we get growth.
Look what I get, though.
All this hate. But wait(weight); heavy is the crown when you trying to uplift, though.
It’s obvious, I got to go against my opposites
in order to diametrically complement my wit, bro,
so this is god in the flesh versus this demigod with little to no theological info.
I mean, the brother that don’t fuck around versus the well-known nympho.

I’m intellectual; you electrical. Well, let’s not compare the type.
Yeah, we both fire, but Myers,
it’s different degrees, and we don’t seem to fare in height(Fahrenheit).

Let’s be clear tonight. For starts, it’s nothing I’m ruling out.
Nigga, I don’t give a fuck nor care; I’ll line a(North Carolina) nigga up.
It’s March; it’s only right that we Duke it out.
Now, they gon’ hoot and shout as you jump around this stage and move about,
but please don’t talk about guns;
you got too many daughters and sons to pulling out.
We can shoot it out.
You know, take ten steps and draw; I’m illustrating how we can duel it out.
I’m a landlord with the pistol. I’m evicting this bullets; they moving out.
And for the record, I’m well-versed, and got hooks; Kareem Abdul your mouth.
You talking sweet, I’m digging deep to get to the bottom of it, pulling that root canal(ruger now).
I’m what the truth is, pal.

I emerged out of the waters like a evolutionary amphibian,
climbing the ladder of battle rap,
and cognitive dissonance has got the comp dissing him.
All 'cuz I washed Fiji, went strict on Stricc,
then got Lyt(light) out of nowhere: Aunt Vivian.
I’m positioning myself to be amongst the elites with the sentences;
I got knowledge, wordplay, punches, angles..
Like, I’m too deep; you can’t compete with this Kemet shit.
I been peeped you as feminine.
I was just waiting, and Boom, you started Surfing
another nigga wave, trying to speak on his penmanship.
Making allegations, then had to retract your statements when
you couldn’t make it legitimate. How ridiculous.

You in these battle rap groups, sharing private information for validation,
dry snitching, blowing up a mean spot.
All these gun bars, huh? You shooting this and shooting that;
nigga, the only thing you would snap was a screenshot.

We done figured you out, Danny, but we figured you’d figure this out too.
You know you be investigating; I’m sure you know me, nigga.
But you remind me of my favorite gun:
always trying to snub somebody, you nosy nigga.
I bet you wish you could summon O.D., nigga.
So he could stand right here and yell “time” in the middle of my rhymes
so I don’t OD, nigga,

but this ain’t AHAT. These the Battlegroundz, where I play at.
You chase the East, they charge you fees,
and you’ve already shown that you pay that.
Did you really believe you’d get that 12k back?
My nigga, if it was all WWE, you wouldn’t say that.
We know you not Macho. Man,
you wasn’t gon’ run up on Randy like a Savage and spray that.
You can save that, ‘cause on the up and up,
how you expect brothers on the Under to take that?
Like you was gon’ leave him Stone Cold, laid flat.

He’ll need a coffin, a coroner.
You got nothing in your Arse(o)nal. You’re out of your league;
all these theatrics outside of the ring and you’re still not the Ultimate Warrior.

Pardon if I’m boring ya.
What, y’all tired of hearing about how he gave them k’s to Rex?
But he supposed to be from the West and paid them checks.
Look, I know we talk about it religiously;
I just figured he muslim the way he kneel to the East to pay respects.

But it’s on to the next shit on your checklist.
“New York is biased.” Why? ‘Cause NuNu called time?
You wasn’t spitting your best shit.
Don’t front and cover up that fact; I’m getting a Vibe,
magazines for everyone who subscribe to that East vers’ West shit.

I’m like a mad scientist with that tech grip; I’ll murk this cat.
Neil DeGrasse Tyson when I work the strap.
I’ll bomb on his bitch. Tell B.O.B. that’s the only time we’ll see a Earth that’s flat.

It could be you and six of your brethren; I’ll drive through, work the weapon.
You squares could run(Koran), but it’ll be more ish(Moorish) if I have to Circle Seven.

You’ll get Smacked mentioning my name with a P.G. reference.
I’m Proving going over and around them Grounds
is the only time you’ll find me P.G. stepping.

I keep it Western. Went on the War Report, then I was supposed to report for war.
They had all these niggas I never heard before,
local N.Y. P.G.s calling up from the corner store.
“Yo, Son, when you gon’ get on Smack? When you gon’ get on Smack?”

I say, when one of them vets want to collide with the rookie.
I was close to the edge feeling like all these heads was trying to push me,
so I’ll go to New York, not to battle, but to let it rattle
on one of them snakes on that line like, “try me, pussy.”
I’d shoot up that whole P.G. class like I was tired of bullies,
and after that, Smack wouldn’t provide me fully.
It’d be just like this lame’s name. Well, let me explain.
After that homicide, the D.A. in(N) N.Y. ‘d be the only guy trying to book me.
Got him.

Round Two
DANNY MYERS
I'm standing over my own dead body, while onlookers have stale faces,
the streetlights above reflecting light off the shell cases.

I don't know what quite happened; the site’s madness,
ambulances, sirens, lights flashing while my life passing.

My spirit outside my body, leaving for the journey,
two police officers hold my wife back while she reaching for the gurney.

A black man had run up on me and popped the nine off.
In the midst of all this chaos, B Dot watches from a sidewalk.

He's wrecked with guilt, his conscience heavy; he's grief-stricken.
He's feeling responsible that I'd become a street victim,

because he knows it was he who said, "follow me I say; this lead I take.”
He got the key, but this combination lets him know even he not safe.

See what I did there? It took the death of me to ascend destiny.
Mindframe of a Dick Gregory in the mid-70's,
so how is it fair a con(Farrakhan) can then step to me?

But his tears resurrected me; it's mysterious, G.
My mind is not from this star system; I'm serious, B(Sirius B).

Bullets are intended for us, or we die when a stray hit us.
That's why I keep my biscuit with me at all times like Dre Vishiss.

I had a homeboy who was red flagging. He banged his hood; he had a bad rep.
I had to witness Blood sacrifice soon as they gave his ass tech(Aztec).

These streets are cold. Look at the brand of pain we at.
How ironic, how they put together Dot and a maniac(Animaniac).

My brain react, ‘cause he trying to put a end to Danny.
I'll hit niggas not even related to you with that extended(,) family.

Your bitch is trampy, but she could ride a dick; homie, ya ho is wild.
She keeps her balance on the wood like Eddie Murphy in Golden Child.

Oh, you gon' label me a drug dealer, 'cause I done served a lil PCP?
Oh, I done put more poison in our community then BBD?
Well, what you didn't see is when I bought that little kid a PS4
‘cause for a dub rock, his mama sold his PS3.

See, I regret some of the shit I done did homie,
like buying food stamps from that smoker, then feeling guilty 'cause her kids hungry.

Yes, I recognize god gave me a talent, respect,
but I was learning about life's checks and balances before I could balance a check.

I already know where I'm headed; that road is just grim.
You can't put fear in a man whose soul is condemned.

See, I sought a job, but I was taught survive against all the odds.
See, the BarGod got these bars from god, but I'm barred from God.

I used to stomp niggas out; that was the best way I punished.
Now I prefer the strap over the kicks like XJ-900’s.

Pay( )less attention. He cold as ice; I’ma unthaw y’all glacier.
I'm the anti-hero to the man y’all call y’all savior.

These bars will leave you crippled;
now I must know, what college you got this knowledge from, Charles, Xavier?

Don't mind me. The shit I be on is beyond whatever B on.
Even if he cold off the top, I’m the wrong nigga to free on(freon).

You gotta be conditioned to stay off the ground with this shit;
this wack emcee got a whole ‘nother round of this shit.
Yikes!

B DOT
See, this that shit that be igging me.
When these punchline rappers want to get “conscious” ‘cause they dissing me.
I find it interesting.
So in your last battles, you only let your gat rattle
in order to fit in with battle rap’s imagery?
Or you taking the high road? But before, it was the low with no dignity.
That’s like shopping for shoes too small to use:
you just took your soul(sole) out in order to fit in, literally.
So look, this what y’all get to see.

A Black Panther convict versus a backpacking hobbit with illiterate nonsense.
All of a sudden Danny Myers want to kick knowledge.
Nigga, you not even a little bit conscious.
You thirty-six, still talking about blowing up.
False flag: we can’t even consider you a legitimate bomb threat.
That whole scheme you just did was all an interesting concept.
Meanwhile, I got the intellect of Jay Elec’, meshed with an intricate Nas depth.
I’m Illmatic in battle rap fashion, fastened together by that same thread
that attaches badges of honor to the sleeve on a fatigue jacket of a Vietnam vet.
Your knowledge is no contest.

What you know about the Anu’, ahkhee?
I’m talking deep research; don’t state the norm.
I’ll have Madji shoot arrows in a blazing storm.
You’ve been warned. Kemet is who they adored,
but you like to learn from some aryan(Sumerian),
so I give my boys the cue and they ‘ll form (Cuneiform).

Swinging swords? Nah, it’s more like knowledge in the clips when I shoot at you.
Toasters in a holster; I’ll have these rounds swinging off the hip like a hula hoop.

Pop at your medulla, too. Your whole team better scurry on.
Nigga, my pops was a shooter too. It’s my genes for me to carry(Curry) on.

I come through walking dead like Mr. Wavy
with that shotty on or have that nine probably.
I’ll shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head, and get this god bodied,

but nah, he, me immortal. If we Kombat, I’m diminishing dude;
sock him. Knock him out where he stand,
have him swinging his head like he waiting on a finishing move.
Listen, it ain’t all about dissing the dude.

I mean, Danny, you cold, B(Kobe).
You put on for L.A.; I’m glad that a few got to witness it.
Oh, you retiring?
We wish you best, but the truth is the West need new representatives,

‘cause you, Diz, Day, the triple D’s, all keeping a(-)breast in your respective position,
but y’all make the West look suspicious,
and you from Writer’s Bloque? Nigga, I’m from a rider’s block;
maybe that’s why we addressing shit different.

I’m just stressing our difference ‘cause here we have a nigga from the hood
that said he not from no hood,
you know, straight out of South Central, a nerd with an attitude,
another O’Shea Jackson, duke. Nah, this can’t be no battle dude.

You all in your battle raps gripping the snub
or fetching it with your pistol, giving that four-fifth a hug,
but never once have I heard you utter a word on whether you Crip or you Blood;
nigga, what set is you from?
And don’t play me dumb, nigga, you know how this done.
I need the head up or your head up get boxed in if you tell me, “it’s none.”
Nigga, what set is you from?
I’m not glorifying gangbanging for one,
but in South Central, we all know the mental of niggas with shit that got to get done.
They put in work, may go to jail, and well, that’s another brother neglecting his son,
and mother can’t protect for the young,
so he get put on a set; that come with a rep and a gun.
You know he got to be a real nigga, not a replica one. So they hit him with a funds,

a little real work to get off; he can help with the mortgage.
Besides, them guys from the other side might ride
and want to give him more triggers. Funerals get expensive. Mama couldn’t afford it;
she just got and supported
her baby boy dialed into the streets and she can’t even call it.
Now, this is that regular ghetto family portrait.
You understand why this vision is kind of important?
It’s uncanny; we should see all this in Danny,
but the picture you painting is kind of distorted.
But you the “BarGod”, so you figuring niggas’d probably ignore it.

The “top dog” on the West can shuffle the deck; you pull his card, it’s,
“Aw, I was that Good Kid in that MA.A.D City,” trying to Kendrick Lamar it,
well that’s when we run up on your van with them cans
and do you like a Kendrick Lamar skit,

let that damn Llama spray.
Oh, you here for Sherane, Danny? We need to know where your grandmama stay.
Get out the car ‘fore I snatch you out that motherfucker. Andale.
The forty clap, it’ll roll him back like a yoga mat. Namaste. Let’s be honest. Hey.

Uncle Red said, you should leave the streets alone. Go ‘head and battle rap.
Yet every time you battle rap, you tattle-tat
‘bout how you handle packs and blast your past; imagine that.
The only reason we knew your talent is ‘cause you got detached from that.
Now you use your talents to glorify drugs and violence;
well that’s that same exact habitat.
And what do y’all extract from that? Perhaps it’s that
little Daniel was never found where the action at.
You wanted to swim with the sharks, but couldn’t play the part.
You had to Go(,) Fish, you couldn’t match with that.

Now you’s an acrobat trying to flip all these lines and shit
‘bout how you supply the bricks and light up the street like a Gaza Strip
but you never shared blood with the Bloods or C-walked in stride with Crips?
You lying prick. Either you got put off the set ‘cause you wouldn’t die for shit,
or you was never out, always in the house on the couch, eating pie with Clips.
Which side is it? I mean, you designed this shit, so you aught to decide the shit.
You claim we got the same ideologies,
but I could tell by your rhyming schemes which god you with,
‘cause you provide the script, claim it was inspired on divine and shit,
but that’s ambiguous language for your disciples that have to decipher wit.

Well, good thing I’m involved with enlightenment. Ain’t no mental enslaving him?
See, you a personification of religion. You know,
gods always behaving like the people that created them. This explains it then.
This deity of yourself you created is made up in the image which relates to him.
Just like the authors of the bible, you went around writing about
your surroundings and different cultures you was engaging in.
“Well, B Dot always mentioning the bible. What you saying then?”
I’m saying, keep your eyes open. All trey of them.
We can’t just believe in a god because he hides behind an amazing pen.
What the fuck could you say to win?

Round Three
DANNY MYERS
You want to know what's killing black men?
It's not the system, racism, gang violence, and all this black on black.
Take a look closer, it's this very culture we call Battle Rap.
This the one place we entertain talking 'bout clapping gats.
I can disrespect your black mother, and black women, and they all gon' laugh at that.
I could ask them for twenty dollars apiece, to build a business within our habitat,
and they all gon' scoff at me, like "nigga, I could get a sack with that.”

Your whole angle is elevating the black concience, yet you participate in this nonsense.
Is this your way of infiltrating our ignorant minds so we can make progress?

Stop it. I don't feel your skill is threat.
I'll give Creflo Dollar 65 from the mill’, then jet.

How the fuck did you think you could outflow me?
My verbal ninjutsu is not a game; this is something you shou’ know, B(Shinobi).

Low key, since '03, I moved weight a couple of ways.
It's like the scale is embedded in me; I call it "stuck in my ways(weighs).

My fellow African, before Smack came to L.A. I was trafficking,
but at the same time, I can tell you what's buried under the Vatican.

I beat niggas to a pulp(pope), no fiction(Pulp Fiction) within my diction.
I'll send you to the merciful
with a pair of scopes(periscope) like a submersible.

God level. Don't let that be a deterrent.
Even though that was a submarine bar, my flow is above the current.

Nigga, I still keep my hammer raised,
‘cause I ain't seen Justice since that nigga got his head blown on Janet braids.

How Poetic, B Dot got all these bars and he still suck.
You can't break down a man that deconstruct your build ups.

I talk real stuff with five percenters, Muslims, Christians.. this is what the game be.
Religion is just a bunch of different branches that lead to the same tree.

But it pains me you scrutinize niggas who bang they lamas.
You talk all this political shit like your last name Obama.
Well remember that kid I sent to the store?
That's symbolic of you, ‘cause niggas never bring us the change they promised.

Nigga, how could I not be mean?
I'm from a different Creed; that's why I should beat your ass to the Rocky theme.

We need to be getting ready for Marshall Law, for the revolution. They gon' fuck with us,
but soon as we try to rise, well(Roswell), get ready for the military(;) cover up.

I left bodies in that debris field, nigga. I'm past nice.
You dealing with a man who possess unseen rounds that can crash sites.

But fuck the grey area; sometimes we got to direct the shots.
In order for my strap to complete the entire picture, it must connect to Dot.

I promise, the type of beef we in gon’ get the morgue’s attention.
What happens after I get his length, width, and height is only for the four to mention(4th dimension).

You bring those brothers to gas you, and to help the crowd decide;
they're instrumental to your lyrics, that's why they're on B side.

For the record, you ain't met no niggas ill as me.
You ain't gotta be associated with the Wu Tang Clan to see a Killa(,) B.

The steel'll be tucked, wrong nigga to go to war with.
I'll expose his chest behind the magazine, like Halle Berry in Swordfish.

The four spit and split him. He on the ground with this shit;
Thank the lord he don't got another round of this shit.
Yikes!

B DOT
Peace to my sisters that be watching my battles. They figure me consciously gifted,
plus I’m handsome, so you know they showing the man some interest.
I love all my queens, but I wear this ring every battle;
please don’t act like you missed it.
See, I won’t do like this dipshit. You know, pursue you for sex, so persistent?
Make you a jump off or a mistress,
create a little life, now make you my wife,
and when you ask about marriage, dismiss it?
Nah. I inherit these merits from the ancestors; I’m different.
I’m bringing back the black family structure
of when it was apparent that parents uplifted.
I ain’t preaching no scriptures.
Look, Danny, I’m far from perfect; I can’t even speak to the distance.
I’m just a work in progress, trying to reach my pinnacle,
and for battle rap, I got minimal interest,

but this is a topic at hand that needs to have the top twist off of the can.
I’m reaching in, exposing your flaws; you my dog and all,
but boy, I’m ‘bout to make you a man. It’s some shit I don’t think you understand.

Maybe I’m the brother that can bring it to life.
I mean, I expose the darkness in niggas.
I did it with Fiji, Stricc, and we all say how I brought it to Lyt(light).
It’s not about who’s wrong or who’s right. I mean, we sort of alike,
both glued to the tube, watching that Family Feud,
but you amused; I’m more confused, like, “who ordered this fight?”
Mommy submissive, Daddy dismissive, staying out on that corner all night.
Daddy the head of the household, but Mommy got to keep her mouth closed;
she give an opinion, it might result in a right.
But tonight, I’m restoring your plight,
‘cause that European religion got you niggas caught in the hype.
They gave you book of stories about men of glory, and you bought the shit, right?
Well why is there no female deity supporting your Christ?
You know, “the father, son, holy spirit”?
You may not hear, but your daughters just might.
Aw, nigga, we gon go there tonight.
I’m not one to judge, but where was the gloves? Nowhere in sight?
Ten kids, all these baby mommas? Come on, Danny Myers, you know that ain’t right.
But I noticed your type. You’s a fiend. You paid to get on Smack,
so it all makes sense how you can’t keep control of your pipes,

but these are the days of our lives. It all ties into religion and the way it’s contrived.
You treat the black woman like a side bitch,
well, ’cause, you was taught she came from your side,

and my nigga, that’s all right. That’s why we got to debate the contention.
I’m certain I’m the right surgeon to make this incision;
I’m splitting the part of your brain that has that Eurocentric dimension.
They Willie Lynched him, really convinced him that the black woman is bitch and

see, that white man is historically wicked,
but if you’re morally gifted, that’s when the story gets shifted.
They got you plugged into the Matrix; it’s basic, but you’re ignoring your glitches.
Like, in the beginning, was the word, and the word was God.
That’s how it go in the scriptures,
but when them agents roll in to get you,
you got to do like Neo and go see your Oracle, and oh, now you know she a sister.
See how the white man just did ya?
He hid god in plain sight, ‘cause he knew you would ignore the enigma.
He can steal frames from your brain, ‘cause he know
you ain’t gon’ pause and analyze the still frames as he motions the picture.
My nigga, I been chosen to get ya.

The black woman is god, Danny. I’m hear to breathe life into that dead message,
‘cause you’s a fuckboy that just likes to fuck, boy;
you went around making bed messes.
Find women you like, you rock, then roll them out: Led Zeppelin.
You damage the box, knock it up, and don’t care about the deliveries;
no wonder why you got fed ex(FedEx)es.

I got to stress this, ‘cause you missed the lessons taught by ancestors.
We put our women on the throne.
That’s the definition for the name; it explains who our set is.

I hope y’all catch this. They created a Adam and Eve to make y’all believe
that a woman was to blame for why we’re deceived. The fuck y’all feeling that for?
I can’t fathom an Adam when every picture I’ve seen, he’s depicted to be
with a belly button, so did he have an um-biblical cord?
Did he come from the womb or not? Don’t ask what I’m getting biblical for.
It’s all suitable; it ties into the root of you
and explains why you treat women like whores.
See, Danny, you exactly the nigga I figured you for.
Just another battle rap nigga that want to get in this ring and spit about war.
But won’t teach your children about stacking and building,
group economics, or how to be an entrepreneur.
As far as battle rap, aw, nigga, you got it for sure,
but here’s the question. Are you selling a product, or are you just a product in store?
See, these are topics that we got to explore.
You say you love this culture; that type of shit don’t even matter no more.
You got all these battles galore.
You thirty-six, still not running your own league; these the things I’m mad at you for.
Perhaps we should travel some more,
back to the past when blacks was treated like cattle; absorb
how the slavemaster wanted us to fuck and breed
so he could push our seeds through that revolving door.
You a 2016 version of that. (Clapping) Encore.

Keeping up with the dumb shit. I ain’t even trying to uplift.
I’m just trying to differentiate,
so these queens know who to gate and who not to fuck with,
before they get stuck with a nigga like you that’ll load their boat, then jump ship.
Never heard you once spit ‘bout your kids, how you hold them close,
but you’ll brag and boast about that pump grip; nigga, that’s punk shit.

How we gon’ raise up these daughters if we not praising their mommas?
Nigga, the black family going through genocide,
and Danny, all bullshit aside, you engaged in that slaughter.
You just a big fucking kid; the way you behave, I’m amazed you’re a father,
but the universe creates and it authors,
and that last page gon’ have your daughters
introducing Danny to a brand new daddy, and you can’t escape from that karma.

We won’t debate any longer. As far as battle rap, I’m done with that,
unless I have a Revelation.
Tell Th3 Saga that’d be the only situation where god is coming back.

I know you all wanted Carter versus Head I.C.E.; trust me, I see the appeal,
street guy against a guy from a completely different field.
You wanted gangster versus nerd; well, tell me how you feel.
You got gangster versus gangster, it's about to get real.

When I took this battle, they told me to keep it light; just jokes, don't kill the hype.
Then I guess I'm the villain, right? Brought a knife to a pillow fight.
You wanted I.C.E.? That's nice; I’m I.C.E. of all different types.
Ice Cube, Ice-T… Okay, mostly Vanilla Ice.

Either way, Carter Deems, you are a strangle little fellow,
probably pronounce milk like "malk" and pillow like "pellow”.

But he's not the type of person that at first you would assume,
I'm more afraid of Carter Deems than any person in this room,

‘cause he's just way too nice. Like creepy, freak type of nice.
Like smiling while he murders you in your sleep type of nice.

But nah, he's not a mad man, he's a cat man;
he'll end up with a cat(-)woman like Batman.
His screensaver is a cat doing jazz hands,
and he gets way too hyped up over CAT scans.

He likes munching on his chap stick, cuddling with fat chicks,
huffing on some catnip and suckling on cat nips.

But after all that mean stuff I just said, I guess you do deserve a hug.
[hug snub]
Not from me, Carter Deems, I meant from somebody you love.
You look and smell like you've been rolling in the mud,
and to be honest, I wouldn't touch you with a pair of rubber gloves.
(I’m sorry. I’m just joking.)

CARTER DEEMS
You don't think Carter a straight G? Well I'll fart on your lady,
eat your poutine then barf up the gravy on your carpet and drapery.
See that's how the old Carter would say schemes,
but my life has been harder here lately, so I can't promise that my bars will be crazy,
but I had five seizures last year, so it's okay if I start a little shaky.
His rhythm is weak plus you look a little beat; you got the heart of a baby.
I'm sick(,) dog, pardon the rabies. Yesterday I ate part of a pastry,
from an artisan bakery; it was large and amazing.
It wasn't hard, it was flaky, and every part of it's tasty.
You can catch me parking an H3,
‘cause I work as a valet parking cars, ‘cause they pay me.
Even when it's dark and it's rainy,
you can catch me in between those white lines like I'm sniffing hard in the eighties.
Atlanta pro, so I'm armed with the Bravery.
He'll lie buried(library’d); I should charge you a late fee.
Yeah my squad's small. Still we ball out; I started on J.V.
This match up more brutal than football between Army and Navy.
My cannon's so big, it's like I'm arming the Navy.
A mad dude with a credit card: I charge when I'm angry.
Talk like a gentleman, but test the kid again,
you'll hear sir cuss(circus) like Barnum and Bailey.


Photo by Zach Macphoto for KOTD.
Overdose on potent schemes, flowing through my brain like dopamine.
I'm dope, I mean, catch me in a V12 rolling clean.
Don't believe me? You can search engine, like you opened Bing.
Make that Cobra sing like yodeling; hit you with a Force that’d make Yoda lean.
Hand me a Razor and I'll flip out, like when my Motorola ring.
Catch me rolling on a roller rink.
As a kid, I gained some weight, too many cookies, too much Ovaltine;
in high school I was a bit rounder. I was an oval teen.
Catch me at a Hot Topic opening on the local scene,
girls crushing my hopes and dreams;
now battle rap’s like prom all over again, ‘cause nobody want to go with Deems.
Still, people are mad that I had this offer.
Well, I'll even battle the battle bloggers
to prove I run these streets like an avid jogger,
then use my hands like I'm bad at soccer.
Grab the choppers, start blasting monsters
like Rick Grimes when he attacks a walker;
this dude will hit a grandpa in the face, then attack his walker.
You're not as nerdy as me; you're not even half as awkward.
I wear weirdness on my sleeve like a badge of honor.
Still I'll leave a bump on his face so big you should go see your acne doctor,
‘cause when I hit you in the face with these cat massagers,
I'll leave this slacker folded up like a pair of my khaki Dockers.

Round Two
CHEDDA CHEESE
You look like, you would smell like, Doritos and mildew.
At first I thought you may have had a disability.. and I still do.

Sit back and watch me work Carter; I'm 'bout to work Carter.
Work harder, ‘cause I'm everything you never were, Carter.

And if you take it to the ping pong court, get wrecked at the rec center.
Press records; I'm a one-man band like Trent Reznor.
Better your best effort, yes, with less effort, less pressure,
head severed for trying to check Chedda.
The best seller, best ever. Doesn't get better; my pen's better,
trendsetter against a bed wetter, (I mean…)

Look, when I call you a bed wetter, that's a factual statement;
I've seen the pee-stained mattress that you have in the basement.

You wear a pair of Pull Ups when you pull up at your grandma's house,
sheets covered in plastic like your grandma's couch.

Chedda-Cheese-1-Zach
Man, you getting bodied by nothing but pee jokes;
you probably eat pea soup while wearing a peacoat.
Got URL fans saying, "Where the gun bars at?"
Me and Carter got it covered, bringing gun bars back.

The streets talk; got to keep watch. Eavesdrop from the tree tops.
Three shots, bring your Reeboks, ‘cause I keep Glocks in my knee socks.
Cheap talk in the T Dot gets you outlined in police chalk,
(Ppp, ppp, chikka, ppp, ppp)
like a white guy trying to beat box.

Catch you on a Friday, see me sitting sideways
’til I pull out out of nowhere like a hidden driveway.
(Bow. Just Joking.)

CARTER DEEMS
When I start bucking that, I put him in a box with no bubble wrap
after I show these long Tec’s(texts) like Rev Run in a bubble bath.
Okay, that's not true at all, but here are some other facts.
You paid for this battle and that’s something you can't rebuttal back,
‘cause I know exactly how much it cost you, and I paid double that.

I didn't even want to do this, but I was bored this weekend; thought I might as well.
I don't care about this battle at all; I just wanted to spend 500 on a flight and hotel.

You watch The Bachelor,
but last week he was busy, didn't have any time and missed it.
You thought I'd be a nice guy, forget it,
‘cause I'm about to give you so many spoilers you'd think I drive a Civic.
Like for instance: Ben took Jen on a date, but he still saw Liz on his nightly visit.
He brought a bottle of wine and sipped it,
which later caused Liz to get into a fight with Bridget,
just to be quite specific,
and you can stand there and act like you don't care,
but that just ruined your night, admit it.
I'm terrific. I can bring hard bars to prove that I can spit it, but my style has shifted,
and I really get too silly, I admit it, but even this guy can get it,
‘cause when I spit that silly heat, he'll see that the sky's the limit.
‘Cause that's when I'm in my bag,
like I'm sneaking on a plane without buying a ticket.

Temple tap. I invented that.


Photo by Christian Andrabado for BattleRap.com.
I got a turquoise ring on my pinkie toe, believe me, bro.
I stay fresh to death 'til I'm six feet below.
I fought the Double Dragons, went three-and-oh. That's on a need-to-know.
Yeah, you can rap but do you need to? No.
Every time you see me go, I spazz out. You can't shake Deemsy flow,
even though I started having Little seizures(Caesar’s)
and I'm not talking pizza dough.
Strobe light...that's what I don't like.
It makes my spine ache, my eyes start to dilate,
a migraine, mind race to the middle of my mind state,
I get wobbly like I'm walking on ice skates, everything starts to go sideways,
Ah— I think I might be having one right now, I can feel my thighs shake..
Oh, never mind, I just had my phone on vibrate. I’m great.

I'll sneak in without tripping the wire,
while this dude gets caught like lint in the drier.
I'm someone you should really admire,
so don't get it twisted like you gripping the pliers.
I know we don't carry the tool, but I raise that heat when I'm spitting the fire,
so this dude will see defeat(Duff eat) like he's having dinner with Lizzie McGuire.

I don't care about this match up, so I raise the heat like I'm holding a match up.
This doesn't stack up. So confident, I'll put a stack up.
So we know you try to act tough, say you hit as hard as a Mack truck,
while I know you don't have a fast punch,
so I won't fall for your hands. That's a bad bluff.
I’ll hit him with a fart so hard it'll make him back up. You should call for backup.
Last week I helped my cousin move his couch; that's how I messed my back up,
so I can barely hold my back up.
I’ll hit him with a mean mug; that's a bad cup,
and I admit it, Bishop, I'm the one who keeps putting your mirror back up.

Round Three
CHEDDA CHEESE
That was really weird. This is my impression of you:
"When arms get raised, that's where my B.O. sits.
I've got five friends with B.O. who all think that B.O.'s sick.
We nicknamed ourselves ‘The B.O. Six’ and came to BO6ix.
How many of us came to T.O. with B.O.? Six."

Man, I feel like I'm watching Pee Wee's Big Adventure in bad 3D,
if he was raised by Stewart from Mad TV,

mixed with a bit of Brick and a little bit Mister Bean.
You're not original at all, biggest phony to hit the scene,
‘cause you stole your whole persona and style from Krispy Kreme.
(Some people know who that is, but you know..)

And you literally had an epileptic fit you were so afraid of I.C.E.,
had you shaking on the sidewalk like a game of dice.

You wanted epilepsy jokes? Another One like DJ Khaled:
He's an epileptic vegan, favorite food is seizure(Caesar) salad.

So quit with the talking. You look like Christopher Robin
stuck in mid-transformation into Christopher Walken.

And Chris Robin can get walking. Just stop it and quit blogging.
In his town, he's a big problem. Big date? He'll be pill dropping,
slick talking and lip locking, just not when the chick's watching.
The Bill Cosby of Milwaukee. The Rick Ross of Wisconsin.

See, they hype you up now cause they're following a trend,
but look at Vince with the Raptors and what they thought about it then.
They see me put you on a map, but you'll fall of in the end,
and we can all watch Carter let Toronto down again.

CARTER DEEMS
I'm finished with the gimmick; sorry if you want me to rap about cats.
Matter of fact, cats are cool, but that was a fad
that I put on as a mask before each battle and match.
I mean, I give my pets a pat on the back,
but my cat was just a substitute I used cause I'm not blasting the gat.
It was a passive attack,
‘cause I don't shoot tec's or use meth or do sex, so I don't rap about that.
But don't worry, ‘cause I'm battling back,
so you can get him a soda and pass me a snack,
‘cause I already ate through Cheese just to prove that I mastered the craft(Kraft).
I'm not grabbing the macs; on the weekend I watch Breaking Bad and relax
until I'm having a nap. These are actual facts,
and on the weekdays I'm in my office, reading an actual fax.

Still, nobody's flowing with me.
I'll break into the championship bout, take 'em both out 'til I'm holding the keys,
beat those phony MC's and let 'Ganik put the chain over my tee like rosary beads.
I'll beat Grandma's Favorite Grandson with ease,
then eat a plate of macaroni and cheese,
so by the end of the night I've beaten Illmac', uh, Roney and Cheese.

But in real life this guy is scary. He'll make that big thing sing like Mariah Carey
that’ll put me in a House of pain(Payne) like Tyler Perry.
After this my life is buried, and not even playing with fire prepared me,
‘cause when he starts cooking, he'll put those flames on my shirt like Guy Fieri.

When he steps out, the gats are ready.
He'll light me up even though the mac is heavy,
so gangster, he’ll probably pop my collar cause I'm acting preppy.
All about the cash and fetti, fast and furious 'til he crash the Chevy,
he'll grab the blam and go H.A.M. while I'm at the deli, just ‘cause I asked for veggies.
When this dude's gripping the biscuit, he's not asking you to pass the jelly,
‘cause every time he eats, he takes it to the Max like Zack and Kelly.
Born to be a sharpshooter, it's in his DNA to blast machetes,
and a gun fight is Thug Life, he'll rat-a-tat my belly like Makaveli.

But I'm not on a crusade against those who rap about guns,
it's just there's a million other things to rap about that I've actually done.
I rap about microwaves,
‘cause when I used the stove, I burned the back of my thumb.
I spit about minivans, ‘cause that's what my parents been driving since back in ’91.
We had a dent on the bumper, had an accident, son.
Stain on the seat, I had an accident, son.
And this is real life, so I don't care if you're asking, "Who won?"
after it's done, ‘cause my life is an average one.
I just like to get people laughing with puns.
I don't do this to make fun of battling; I do this cause battling’s fun.

So with that being said, I’ll pull up to a Hobby Lobby in a drop top Maserati
same color as a pot of coffee if that pot of coffee was the same color as hot wasabi.
I'll take my shirt off; I’ll flash for the cash like the paparazzi.
Live life like a kamikaze;
Carter's so savage, you better keep a chain on this animal like a Tamagotchi.
That's time, you got me?
Right away. I came all the way from L.A. to this show to fight,
and don't trip, I'm not about to let you down like Quill did with a choke tonight.

You already got bodied by Diz,
so after tonight, this’ll be your second time dying in a row.
They'll be saying you won(one) zero back to back like binary code.

I do freestyles, multi's, punches, wordplay;
you just do bar after bar, and you're known to reach some
while I(eye) contact from every angle like the Mona Lisa.

Pussy, I really rap,
so he's fucking dead(,) people,
‘cause I'm coming(summing) for a cold body like necrophiliacs.

And he'll react like,
"I'm a cannibal; I don't just kill, I feed of it, but only if the rules are fine.”
Well since he's a cannibal,
I'll make him eat his backbone, and watch as he chews the spine.

Don't believe it? Boy, fuck with me;
these hands left more kids split than joint custody.

Joints rupturing when your cranium straight splatters;
occipital lobe over there, frontal lobe over there, now let's see if his brain matter,

‘cause King Of The Dot let a killer loose like the OJ Simpson case panel
to put a middle eastern in a bag, behind bars, like a Guantanamo Bay scandal.

Get your face scrambled with hands thrown at a ferocious speed,
but he doesn't need to be an R&B fan for Gjo to see(Jodeci)
that I'ma okay seeing Gjo-Gjo(KC & JoJo) catch a hook on a slower beat.
You scrapping is something we just don't believe.

"But Christ the second coming if you rise—“ Shut up!
What I could do with one blade
will remind you of a confession booth from his whole appearance,
‘cause he'll be spilling his guts after I come clean across(a cross)
and I'll be leaving a(believe in a) holy spirit.

The hole will spill and tear his cavity;
doctors will have to support the core(Corps) like military families.

I’d bury all(burial) your cast; get(casket) dropped
‘cause you wouldn’t(wooden) box. This is your funeral now.
No, pay attention. I said "burial", "casket" "wooden box", this is your funeral now;
did you catch the plot?
[walks around snapping fingers]
Woah, woah, woah, y'all thought I was slipping? Man, just stop.
That wasn't a choke;
I just figured he needed a moment of silence before the casket dropped.

But if he survives, I’ll put the piece up right at his teeth and I’ll just
keep on firing 'til he eats the magazine: Reader’s Digest,

or bleed when I send one swing to just finish then leave you stiff and
sleeping with your teeth next to you like senior citizens,

or leave him splitted with one punch in the head to come and just shred or
crush in his septum when it bust in the center,
fucking up your whole appearance like a public defender.

You love to pretend these writtens you've given a futuristic image to,
like this is new, is misconstrued,
‘cause the simple truth’s you're living through an artificial formula like infants do.

While the rest of us were taking a match
any date that we can and breaking our backs,
Smack gave you a way to get past,
so now you're like Moses, the way your power came from a snake and the staff.

That bridge is how he's risen, but now he wouldn't be shit without these,
so it's safe to say The Dude wouldn't be the same without Bridges
like the Big Lebowski.

You use religious references to get cheap reaction
off their applicability to the general public,
then set them up with collective subjects but wedge in one hit direct enough that
when you end with punches, the perception of it's impressive, but
it's just a crutch to pretend it's substance.

Then this punk just turned his back on Smack to come to King Of The Dot but it was..
suicide, you knew you'd die; it's a cry for help,
‘cause now you've lost everything and everyone; you're all by yourself.
You're like Waldo, playing Where’s Waldo: you need to find yourself.

You can take any bar from any verse from any rounds on me,
and the crowd will safely say that every round’s on me,
and after I get that money tonight, I'm heading straight to the bar,
and you best believe it's gon' be rounds on me.

GJONAJ
(You guys ready to not see gimmicks?)
Alright, that Reader's Digest bar was impressive,
way doper than every other rapper who said it.

This battle was supposed to be for five thousand.
The fuck happened to Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is?
Pussy had Organik call me. (Yes you did)
He said, "That amount of money is life changing.” I said, "He may be right.”
But if five grand is live changing, you need to change your life.

And now I got to rob his parent's crib for fucking up my motivation;
if it was five grand, there wouldn't be any(B&E) reason for this home invasion.

I will kick in the door, shoot the whore. You want more dead? Pistol to your head.
Show me to the safe, and I'll be in the vault quicker than Cortez.

Caustic, Pat Stay, The Saurus, Bigg K, I don't give a fuck who you have involved.
I have evolved; bodies once sloppily rotten are now frozen in catalogs.

Serial killers keep trophies, but I'll take cash in hand.
A thousand for the sacrifice: (What's that?) a rack of lamb.

Well I'll be damned, just to see you live in Hell.
This is Silence Of The Lambs: I hope you're living(live in) well.

It puts the lotion on, live in well? How could he fucking win?
Buffalo Bill wouldn't be comfortable in his fucking skin.

It's heavy builder vers' extra filler; they expect a thriller,
these people crazy. Fuck Steven Avery, even my set(-)up killer.


Photo by Banshee for KOTD.
This is not a new release; it ain't gotta do a piece.
Of course I'm fighting a bum; I made a living on the streets.

Fork in the road, the dead end up on another path.
You should've stayed in your lane; you're fucking trash.
You got a little buzz, thought you'd be a fucking match,
but you gon' die leaving a mark that doesn't last.

Did it sting? Then bring up the fucking past.
Yeah, the Earth quaked, but the magnitude is just an after thought,
‘cause the shit that landed in the building wasn't the same after( )shock.

(Yeah, wasn't was it?)
So is it my fault for being groundbreaking if they didn't get the shit?
See, the future can learn from the past, but not exist in it,

so I'm past that. It's not that he can't rap,
I'm just so ahead of my time, you're currently trapped in a flashback.

You're going to lose a rack flat; was it worth the hype?
You can either wait, or(waiter) or have too much on your plate for the perfect bite.
You see what happens when it's catered? Serves you right.

See, your eyes are bigger than your stomach. That food’s a little closer.
You're gonna realize I'm a killer at large and testing(intestine) me
will be the reason you die just(digest) a little slower.

Now did that shit faze you?
‘Cause they said when I face you, phase one was to break you;
they fucking hate you. Look who they gave you.
Think U.S. pennies, ‘cause you're worth less than the cost it took to make you.
(Early!)

Round Two
PSYCOSES
Yo, he just had that Silence Of The Lambs bar,
but that whole scheme was straight up lame.
I'm not Buffalo Bill, I'm Hannibal Lecter,
’cause once Psyco' broke out the pen, there's no saving face.

This round is for everybody who thinks that my shit is all filler.
Now watch me get this body on cam(Cam): Von Miller.

I'll kill him with hands sharper than Wolverine with the titanium blade,
start rearranging your face
'til it looks like you have Hills Have Eyes creature uranium traits,
have your DNA looking bad when the machete spray in your face,
but if you get in my grill and you're grilling, I'm willing to push your grill in,
so start playing it safe.
Stoop Kid from Hey Arnold:
you don't wanna get stepping over stares(stairs), so stay in your place.

It's safe to say, you go down that path,
you'll take a left and a hook on the right like you were asking directions.
You'll be feeling the burn(Bern) like you want Sanders elected.
Having this bitch head in a box like Brad Pitt in Seven,
when you get beat with bare(bear) hands like that Panda in Tekken.


Photo by Christian Andrabado for BattleRap.com.
You’ve been acting pretentious,
so I'll leave him stuck up with his nose in the air like this dude's snobby,
walking around with half a face from one hit like a House of The Dead 2 zombie.

When the dude's talking, I'm sending the other hand swinging;
that'll make you bite your tongue like a bad seizure,
hands jabbing like Pan's Labyrinth: the kid'll get eaten if my hands see him,
and beat him, 'til you all see one land like Pangaea.
All sea? One land? Pangaea?

We can see that you don't respect the scene, so I take it as disrespect to me.
This is for every time I stopped at the gas station to take a piss,
and your cousin wouldn't give me the restroom key.

Just you see, it'll be like Calicoe's dad, the way I'm taking off on son.
Get your gang involved, and trust, engage in brawl with us,
the same result then comes, but if engaging’s not enough,
then they can all get clubbed like Megan Fox's thumbs.
I'm not the one.

Last battle I said, "One arm waving got you running home like a third base coach,”
but for you, I brought something worse,
when you see two arms waving like Th3 Saga in church.

You thought that every verse was gonna 3-0 me,
but I'm already amounting two-nothing,
and turned that amount into nothing,
and that's why your bars ain't amounting to nothing,
‘cause this is Everest to a desert strip: this a mountain to nothing.

Dude's bluffing.
This a fire cracker to what happens when you're making an atom split.
You aught to quit cause my attic wit is more adequate than Anne Frank's attic width.
You told OT 7even "shank to his neck, I’m apple picking.” Well ain't that some shit?
One boot will turn his Adam's apple to apple sauce with his larynx squished.
Then I'll reboot him...and not even Steve Jobs could get him his Apple fixed.
That was a Genius Bar.

And against Born you said,
"It's hard when everyone you know’s(nose) crooked like Owen Wilson.”
That was so hot; stop.
Quit acting like you when your folks call the shots,
and lighten your tone like Michael Jackson
before everybody that you know’s(nose) falling off.

This reminds me a little bit like Daylyt vers’ Iron Solomon.
I'm not calling this a mirror match; let me give y'all the clear vision.
This reminds me of Daylyt versus Iron Solomon
‘cause in this battle, you need to self reflect on your mere(mirror) image.
(Early!)

GJONAJ
Hibbity, dibbity, flibbity, jibbity-- shut the fuck up.
You want to know what everyone on cam wonders?
How do you spit twice as fast and have half the substance?

You're fucking trash. Look, I appreciate the fans that remain loyal,
but there's a difference between someone that'll lie to you
and someone that'll lie for you.
There's a difference between someone that'll kill for you,
and someone that'll die for you.

That's why I don't give a fuck about your fans.
I can count how many people I trust on Jason Pierre Paul's hands.

Look, don't get defensive or you'll miss the message.
See, I needed a match; he was the natural selection, and I hate that.
It was dramatized, fossilized, let's go way back.
There was a missing link; it seemed our wins didn't explain that.
Now for y'all in the building, who can't rewind or replay that:
“natural selection", "fossilized", "missing link”, “it seemed Darwin didn't explain that”.


Photo by Christian Andrabado for BattleRap.com.
See I'm gonna do that all night and clearly kill him,
but first, let's light up the building.

It's time to switch on him like a step child; this next style nastier than a meth smile.
Die from biting: West Nile. Circles change, shape shift, alien reptile.
I'll crack his Skully; thought it was the X-Files.
American Sniper: I'll go from this Kyle to Chris Kyle.

Confirmed kill. It gets worse still.
I use violence to paint the pig; you're a human virus.
Matrix shit, replay, then glitch:
you'll see the same body over and over. Agent Smith.

Which is why we don't cam a lot(Camelot).
This is not your (k)night; everything I spit sort of lands a lot(sword of Lancelot).

This is my kingdom. I alone am ruler;
they measured my successes soon as my foot fit through
It's quicksand. There's a point I'm 'bout to get to.
Struggle and die faster, did it sink in? I'm the last thing you should've ran into.

Why stop when I got more to prove? I'm Cyclops:
this one I(eye) can't afford to lose. I'm in your blind spot.

Don't get stuck in traffic. Oh, you heard the story?
Well it's working for me. Get stuck in the middle: purgatory.

Fans get to judge the living, and the dead; see, it's all an angle.
Thirty pieces of silver and a fallen angel,
hanging with the twelve before I got a cradle,
and made bread off the body before I got the table.

The last supper. Bow your head as I read a verse.
Dear Lord, tonight one of us is going to leave the Earth.
May the peace be with you, ‘cause if I see him first,
parum-pa-pum-pum, all I brought was a drum, like Jesus' birth.

See at first, wise men followed a star.
Nowadays, fuck that, just follow the bars.
(Salute!)

Round Three
PSYCOSES
Let’s get it popping, G; I’m here to School(-)boy on cue(Q), no collard greens.
So face it, fam, it's basic math:
I'm the prime one, so you can't even be at odds with me.
I bring Fury to this field like a Ottawa soccer team.
I doctor these pupils: optometry,
running through every body in my path like a Hotel Rwanda scene.
This is Man Vs. Food and it's my job to eat.
Even when I'm freestyling off the top, it's clean;
think Sub Zero from Mortal Kombat: I body frees(freeze).
All these squares around make the game bored(board): Monopoly.
You talk a lot about knocking in noggins clean and socking teeth; stop it, please.
Like couples locked in monogamy rocking promise rings, we never saw you swing.
You say you'll start shooting stars, calm it(comet), please,
or guns(organs) get brought to the table like a Dahmer feast,
long nose in front of your face all day like what Caustic sees,
or catch you and you boo when you're on the streets,
put your boo in a bag like Monster's Inc.

It's odd ‘cause he said he was gonna hurt Diz's career,
then we all just died from laughter
when you forgot your lines at half verse and started calling time quick after.
Hey, you guys wanna know what rhymes with "calling time quick after?"
[Caustic:] Getting bodied by Dizaster!

But tonight you're gonna get it bar for bar,
‘cause that's what everybody here's wanting,
but I didn't write a single jelly fish line,
so tonight no one's gonna have a problem pronouncing this a clear body.

A clear homi, so act a fool and every part you have in you will tear apart,
then black and blue from every scar
and faggot, you will have to prove you carry heart,
when we see this monkey stand up for himself like the evolutionary chart.

Did you hear that Darwinism bar he had in his last round when he said it son?
Yeah, well fuck it, I got a better one.
Are you familiar with the Theory Of Evolution?
‘Cause Darwinism best explains how this match was concepted.
See, you never learned to adapt to the present,
so naturally, it only took one disaster(Dizaster) to end him,
then due to the growth in my bio,(-)logically I was the natural selection.

After you stepped in, it was like Smack had a sex doll fetish,
the way they blew up this fake fuck and gassed his rounds,
while I got slept on by more battle rappers than Organik's couch.
While I had to find a way to try to pay to fly the states,
and trapped in the traffic lines for days, the price was waived right away
for this guy to take the diamond lane to the fastest route,
so the staff on Smack is over half the reason they have him out,
so The King Of The Dot was happy to have him out,
but I'll be happy when we have him out.

But after now, I ain't takin losses, but if they say I lost then
I'm taking off rocking The King Of The Dot chain with Illmaculate hanging off it.

You were taking off when your PG release lifted
his weak image, to be pictured like he's an elite figure;
now they use your bull pen for a warm up like relief pitchers.

You use historical figures and facts that are bound to be
convincing for half the crowd to think it's skill, but in actuality,
it's a gimmick you have to cloud to scheme,
with your simplicity masked as challenging,
‘cause the significant fact left out of these writtens you have are found to be
missing the factuality and littered with massive fallacies
and hidden within a fictitious image with little in practicality.

For example, you told JC,
”They knew I was gonna sleep you as soon as they set a date.”
Set a date/sedative. That's a reach.
Then you said, "I could beat you with the bars I land of the free if the pen in gone"
Pen in gone/pentagon. That's a reach.
Then you said,
"you'll all get fed embalming fluid unless you find somewhere for ‘em all to hide.”
For ‘em all to hide/formaldehyde. That's a reach.
You can battle John John in a Mosque and still out rhyme a don.
Out rhyme a don/Ramadan. That's a reach.

Faggot, please. There's an obvious gap in everything you say.
Getting reaction off bars that don't make sense
only makes you look stupid in the long run. Just ask DNA.

Round three, it's getting hot in here. King Of The Dot, y'all know that slogan.
[Crowd:] Get him the fuck out of here!
Hell no, get the beanie on this geek the fuck out of here.
You're afraid of immigration; get this Syrian refugee the fuck out of here.
Half your bars don't even make sense, get every fucking reach the fuck out of here.
I killed rappers Back To Back here because I love Toronto;
somebody get Meek the fuck out of here.

GJONAJ
Yo, who the fuck is he talking to every round?
You better make like a bitch in her wedding gown and settle down.

Oh, you made(maid) of honor? Well we are not the same.
A loss in reality, I'm how he got a name.

I ignore pain and press your(pressure) points. What an easy win,
look how you act. You punked your(acupuncture)self. Why needle him?
You're so close to death like senior citizens.
Needle, sew clothes?

No joke, while he was thinking about what to write next,
I was doing random licks like dyke sex.

Bitch head in the box, since you mention the movie Seven,
guess you could use a lesson on who to threaten.
There goes all of Rob progress like a 2-11.
Robbery in progress? 2-11?

Plus I said his name. Jesse James, it is Robert right?
Well, if I'm robbed tonight,
as in, you skip town and you're found alive,
leave with the cash and the judges are on his side,
he'll be the next Robert(robber) to die famous like Bonnie and Clyde.

So run and hide. You do not want to be Robert E. Lee.
Granted, history repeats, except I'm leaving a twist:
fuck being Civil, War is where you'll, uh, cease(Ulysses) to exist.

Bitch, I slave over linking(Lincoln) these concepts, no exaggeration,
but there's still free dumb(freedom) for Blackout like emancipation.

Run the chain.
Rone and 'Mac, hunger— hold on, I'm still battling what’s-his-name. What a shame.

‘Cause outside of KOTD, you are not known.
You are just a captive, I would've capped if you affected my Stockholm.

Stockholm; you're skull and bones right away.
Kidnapped, locked away. Escape alive? Not today.
Ransom, you gotta pay. Danger, two kind of ways:
Lotta Zay or Jonbenet, I’ve got to say.

For another four K, you would've got a person buried.
Rem—, I'm not a Hitman, I'm a mercenary.


Photo by Banshee for KOTD.
A pallbearer; don't get carried away. This is not a classic.
I'm Paul Bear Bryant: I'm coaching him in the casket.
See this is what happens when you get it backwards,
when animals run the zoo and get to pick the matches.
You get the poor vers' the top one-percent; we're in different classes.
Show me where the cash is.

I'm Ali before the Frasier fight.
Fuck a war, you know my name. Gjonaj, say it right.

I'll be remembered as a legend; you're a man forgotten.
Your material has a shelf life; it's black and rotten.
It expired before you did, and that’s the problem.
I'd rather make you a current event than rap about 'em.

I had to show him what the difference is,
‘cause feeding lambs to the wolves seem ignorant,
but what's a shepherd do when the sheep ain't listening?
(Goodnight!)

Nitty, tonight, I advise there be no horse-playing. Bring your best.
This was a fresh move. For you, still a L, ‘cause I ain’t Chess.

They said my style placed me top of the rookies.
Well, I feel like Trey in the crib,
‘cause punching with tiers(tears) finally got me this pussy.

Nitty, what’s goody? Fuck that you brought your block for support,
‘cause I can tell these niggas not what you thought.
The first Quarter with a problem getting dropped, but if a Glock the resort,
you’ll hear shots popping quads(pop in Quad); think Pac in New York.

See, quarters is Quads, the same place where niggas set it on Pac.
Nitty, you just a stepping stone to help me get to the top,
but apparently being drugged is your plot.
Y’all think not? He was fiending to be on Smack; now he begging for Roc(k).

But they sent me to put to put the chalk to him,
so if I Am Legend, then watch how I wash dog while I talk to him.

Just ‘cause The Poet mark you a genius,
that don’t mean you on point, son, ‘cause you on Kevin(’s) Johnson in Phoenix.
I get to sparking these ninas,
well, you’ll be Denzel in He Got Game: go from the box to you talking with Jesus.

See, y’all the reasons niggas thinking they’re tough,
‘cause repping that Fourth Quarter only means shit’ll change for a buck.

Hold up. See, all this crip shit you spit out your mouth
don’t mean nothing when my niggas en route.
He’ll white flag once my click at his house;
that’s when you see these niggas In Living Color,
‘cause after the first clip, the bitches come out.

I mean, these Fourth Quarter niggas ain’t hard. They scared for ya;
soon as you fired on, they(day) off: go Craig on ya,
or I’ll rob you ’til your bread’s shorter.
Put that drum(-)stick to your thigh;
you either come off the chicken or lose a leg, Quarter.

But you ain’t in the streets at all, you bum.
Your heart weren’t strong enough to run that base: you John Q’s son.

You strapped up? Well, I’m armed too, chump; the war’s started.
Fuck your vest; let it scream on caps: I’m Troy Martin.

Wait, pardon. No sparking, gun butt with the mean grip.
The serial(cereal) smack his face like he riding with Queenzflip,

‘cause we ain’t slip with straps. What’s cooking?
I’m on my Voletta Wallace: I brought that Big popper(Poppa) back through Brooklyn,

so fuck Rum. Besides, I be drinking on that Henny,
so ain’t shit to leave him stinking from a semi-.
They gassed him up, thinking he gon’ hit me,
but he don’t want to be the one sent(cent) to face the right:
that’s Lincoln on a penny.

And I still got the weapons to end it,
so you can go from the right to bare(bear) arms, like the second amendment.

I extended the sweetest piece,
so if Beas’ need this West Coast nigga dead by thirty, I’ll make it Ea(z)y, E.

He ain’t beating me, nor none of these fucking faggots.
If you got rage to come after Ave, just don’t be average,

Rum Nitty vs. Ave
‘cause you talking it like they’re straight killers.
Soon as he hooked, put money on their book like it’s JPay.
I don’t care if you crip bang, bitch.
One shot’ll finish this Fourth Quarter in Phoenix; I don’t Bull in the game, six.

Y’all pump packs and shit?
Wait, backtrack. Fourth quarter, Phoenix, that game six shot was Paxson, bitch.

I stash that fifth and beat the foul out ya,
then point it at the back of the head: that’s Alfalfa.

It ain’t nothing tough ‘bout ya. See, I stay fight-ready,
and I’ll off the nigga cap: that’s CakeLyfe Prezzy.

How he gon’ check me? Y’all gassing this nigga like he goes so hard.
It’s with a scam and on the card; you like a Zoe God,

but you ain’t getting real dough, nigga.
Nobody on foot(-)ball between bars but a field goal kicker.

I fear no nigga, so let him be stupid to prove he truly swing;
put a clear round in this pussy: my shooters NuvaRing.

Fuck who he bring, ‘cause if they cross them trenches,
he the first down, soon as he get to Fourth and inches.

Wait, but you’re Writer’s Bloque, right?
Well, where the fuck them clowns when you need them?
Soon as J see(JC) the Big (K)cannon, them rounds gon’ delete him,
but Danny get the shotty right in his mouth when I meet him;
think Yo Gotti, ‘cause soon as It Goes Down, end of(In the) D.M.

And since Magic want to know who’s a new killer,
y’all know The Answer.
Hey, I(A.I.) can shoot and reenact how you step over Lou(Lue) niggas.

Fuck what this clown come spit,
‘cause when I’m smoking the Fourth Quarter, it only mean he down one (-) zip.

RUM NITTY
We got Rum Nitty vers’ Ave. Damn.
Smack got me moving backwards. You don’t see that I’m the truth?
It’s like I dropped a tier(tear) to give you this shot: I’m Nino on the roof.
Don’t leave out the venue, or see niggas squeezing out the coupe.
My white boy from Queens say, “Soon as your done leave, he(Dunleavy) fi’n’a shoot.

They brought the best to him,
and they bet. Norbes and Myers put paper down for this shit: public restroom.

Let’s get to it. I’ll fuck your bitch pussy with the nine barrel. Nitty tripping.
Make sure your girl’s tore(tour) with the mill’(Mill) like Drizzy dissing;
then he gets it. If I forget the mittens,
I’ll slide through with two socks on the Tom: that’s Risky Business.
Or he get the blade; stick it his temple, twist it,
pull it out, and run it back in your head like you’re reminiscing.
The punch crazy, but the setup get caught later like Jimmy Henchman.

I’m dope, nigga. I’ll OD in this bitch if I come out the coat with it,
then mark you out before the chest shot: Pulp Fiction.

If I whip the piece, your family’s fucked.
Headshot your mom’s sister; they gon have to M.O.P. your auntie(Ante) Up,

handle what? Niggas dying. You’ll see the flash from behind when the milli’ light him.
That was fire, coming from the background like Gwitty hyping.
Lift the iron; I’ll let a dummy go off the top like 50 Tyson.

But they say you washing me.
I said, “Cool. Cut the check, and he’s who I’ma air out next(necks) like a tracheotomy.

Don’t lie to me, ‘cause I’ll be at your crib knocking with a big fifth, that bitch Shining.
Catch what the nickel send(Nicholson) through the door, nigga, here’s Johnny.
Something fat in a little coat; it’ll be a big body.
Catch the Tommy, Boy, it rip your back like Chris Farley.

If I raise, shit sparking.
I’ll let that bitch go *blakka*(block a), nigga, like he Facebook stalking.

Ave-vs.-Rum-Nitty-Nitty-1
I’ll be at your door and all.
The whole house’ll rest(arrest),
‘cause that shit you on ain’t cool; you took it too far, now I’m going off.
I know he’s soft. From the jump I get it in, so Many Men die when the coin toss.
Nah. I got a hundred in the drum to get busy with.
He try to run, guess whose back get 50 sent(Cent) in it.

I lock and load, riding out with the squad for sho.
Fourth. I get it jumping for the Quarter off top, nigga, I’m the G.O.A.T.,
fucking maricon. Two shots leave Roc(k) laid on Ave; it look like cobblestone.

You copy, holmes? One from the can pop at him;
I’ll let it fly. It Will break up Ave like Hancock landing.

What your hands like, family? You’ll get your chin broken.
Right, left, left, right, you’ll get clocked back and forth like hypnosis.

I’m a forty sparker; I’ll let it wet across your forehead like holy water.

He knows we’re talking; me, I’ll lift it and squeeze.
He try to dip, then this shit erase a (eraser) back like when your earring missing a piece.

Gun line king. I used to let the can go daily.
Beam on it; I’d inf’ a mill’(Infamil) and catch you with the semi- lack(Similac),
and that’s what the can’s for, baby(cans for baby).

We don’t keep it cool. Real life shit, I keep a tool. Pull it, squeeze, and shoot.
Let ten open up on his face like peek-a-boo.

He done joined the Cave. So now he think he royal every time he come around, right?
Well I’ll give you kings ten,(Kingston) Ave. Head shot, lift your Crown Heights.

I’ll run inside, lace your crib, shooting over the table shit. Take his ribs.
Bet five racks I won’t miss this trash nigga; I’m Money Making Mitch.

Real shit. You can’t keep it real yourself.
Nigga, suicide or I’ll do the job; you decide. Kill yourself.

Round Two
AVE
Hottest in the city; they heard that I'm really poppin'.
I'm good on every block; I ain't gotta be milli'(Milly) Rockin'.

Ave nice, and the last dude to doubt that, nigga died fuckin' with the bars.
He went out like Blizzard; you get the picture.

I was plannin' to kill you in the future.
They wanted to see the king this March: I'm Martin Luther.

You just hyped up where you matter, but now that I get at 'em (atom/Adam),
even (Eve) they see you bodied, bitch, that ain't bitin' in the Apple.

I'ma snap him, take it past rap, I bet I'll leave him there,
as soon as I eyeball a Quarter like I don't need the scale.

Tell your people bail, 'cause I won't e'en speak,
just *shhh* aim(shame) on a nigga, then I O.D., B.

But he ain't gotta get the Glock, goddamn it.
Nigga, he'll be socked up like when you give a backshot standing.

I could handle him with a mean right,
but on the other hand, a pump can (pumpkin) light up the face like Halloween night.

They just seem hype, you know, clown face, sound brave,
throw they fours up like they wild, that's what wild raised;
that shit for the crowd, ace.
Bet if we scrap, y'all gon' see his troops(') jet in the back:
that's Colonel Guile's stage.

Ave-vs-Rum-Nitty-Ave-1-

It's child's play; the Internet digging this fuckin' clown,
You think you Pac? Well try to be (D)igital (U)nderground.
'Cause can't no fuckin' dummy play me.
My little dog be goin' bananas, kickin' cans; even my puppy monkey, baby.

But I ain't get patted down, I'm concealin' a Smith n',
so watch your lips when a real nigga spittin'.
I go to kickin' my rounds and hear these clowns or get the feelin' they trippin',
I'll dump the forty while I'm cookin': that's steel in the kitchen.

You see the difference? With punches I'm a animal, duke,
even handle you with the hands (Hans), 'cause these zoo landers too(Zoolander 2).

See, I can beat this geek up,
or with the stick cap a round on the eye, then shell his body like he Mr. Peanut.

Y'all got me fucked up. What, y'all don't think that we hold lead?
I kick up in the spot, that glock to his forehead;
if he don't open up that box for the bread,
then what he face even uglier if locks get cut: that's O-Red.

Then I'm Swayze when that shotty through spittin',
'cause as soon as you see the bitch run up on me, watch the body get lifted.
Who wanna (D)irty (D)ance? Thirty in the can sparkin',
twenty-five in the 4th Quarter like Reggie in The Garden.

You don't wanna lose your life right here.
You'll end up with a light pop at the head; now that's a bright idea.

My nigga Law told me punch out silly; Rum on a roll.
Well I'll end it, Ty; I doubt it if this bird out-spit me,

See, he ain't even peep that word out, did he?
I said: "end(N) it, Ty" put that together; I ain't worried 'bout Nitty,

'cause Cornell's not a shotta,
I'll flush Corn' and your shit. You'll pass, but you won't die just(digest) proper.

I'll get him popped up. Matter of fact, naw, I'll kill his ass,
dome shot, head hit his shoulder, look like the Thriller dance.

See, I could give him jabs, 'cause that left done left a lot shook,
or hold a round at the neck, look what the shot put (shotput).

That Glock cook, but the rifle round is madness.
I'll touch through the lens: that's Calvin glasses.

Or I'll catch him with his folks hangin', close-rangin', low aimin',
both bangers ringin' together look like I'm rope swingin'.

Bro think I'm joking, but I'll smoke him on the scene,
two grips rippin' his shirt: he Hogan in the ring.

Fuck you mean? You know we talk that slick talk. That stick talk,
bullet in his shoe if he move; now tell this Crip walk.

RUM NITTY
So you and Roc family now huh? Boy, that shit fake.
I whip a big blade, it’s about one foot; it’s for your kin, Tay (Kinte).
Get slayed, stand over the body with a stick; wait.
You’re number 2 in your city, you’re used to being under a big k (Bigg K).

I’m straight to it; I be going for blood from the jump.
Radio Raheem rings: I don't show a hater love(hate or love) when I punch.

Get your mug pushed in. Jump, I'll let a slug cook him.
Ironic how I’m going to destroy Ave (diss Troy Ave), but I love Brooklyn.

Just expect I’ma shoot you.
You press my buttons, soon as I see money, I’ma pull out; does this register to you?

You thinkin I’ma get killed, that’s grimy,
'cause what I kick, give you three clear rounds to the side, like an Air Max 90.

I’m finna have the blueprint to kill this geek if this works out.
Y’all ain’t peep Verb vs. SB? I started off with the remedy (Remy’D) in the first round.

I let it ring.
If he survive, your man in(Manning) surgery next(neck);
he come back and get the second ring.

I'll visit your city with ‘matics popping, and I’m robbing,
trying to get rid of your House In Virginia like Magic Johnson.

Rum Nitty vs. Ave
I’ll clap an artist. Good shot: that’s a marksman.
Pull a bow and put an arrow in his face; Ave a target (avatar).

I send my young niggas dumping out the steel.
They let one off; that first pop warn a(Pop Warner) nigga how the young'ns in the field.

For real. I got a clip full of hollows for whoever talk.
I’ll leave four of these bitches smoking on your roof like Set It Off.

No matter vet or a rookie,
'cause I been letting loose ever since I came out, baby,
but the key goes (kegels) to flex on a pussy.

Pussy. Get pistol whipped with the Mac. I’ll Big Pun a bitch,
so if this guy goes (goggles) upside your head it’s Capital Punishment.

Suck a dick. I’m known to smoke bitches.
I’ll make a nice nigga hang it up. Literally, you missed the punch;
that means I’ll rope a dope nigga.

I gotta aim slanted when I hold the four spitting.
Sideways, I'll peel out a round on Ave, like I’m Tokyo Drifting.

Behind these bars, he going through some shit: Shawshank escape.
I get it popping. Pet adoption: I put a dog in his place.
I give a fuck if a nigga big; I’ll be all in his space.
You can be Tyson cut; don’t mean you want parts in a fade.

But y’all call it shaking right? Cool, I got you a little later.
The nina kill him. Two of these’ll peel him.
I’ll black and let it fly in his face like Feed the Children.

You type done. You’ll lose all train of thought when the nine dump.
A head shot'll make him blank it (Blanket) out like Mike’s son.

I’ll light one. You make a move and get done dirty,
the D.E. take off size if you jump early.

Remain calm, or the blade on him,
then I run it across Ave like I’m jaywalking.

‘Tez on Twitter, acting like he want smoke; okay, partner.
If the fifth in the shorts, then I’m whipping it on Cort’ (court) like James Harden.

I’ll straight box him; he say something crazy, I’ma swing.
2K free throw: soon as he get to the line, we get it shaking on the screen.

Don’t try and scare me. I got nice hands and something nice handy,
and I’ll pop a round (around) in your life like a white family.

KG gave me the extra magazine like “you might want to beware, not scared.”
You'll get a headshot. That clip I got from Kevin, bakin’(Bacon); I’ll let it air up there.

And your squad can’t jump in; this is your bag.
Joey Jihad shit: you gotta take these punches on your own(,) Ave.

I don’t like you bitches,
so watch the boy from the Quarter(-)black and enlighten niggas.
Large slug, I ice you with it;
nothing small’s in the clip, the little nigga spit big (B.I.G) 16s like Sky’s the Limit.

Real shit, you can’t keep it real yourself.
Nigga, suicide or I’ll do the job, you decide. Kill yourself.

Round Three
AVE
To all you little niggas sending shots at the game, scram.
Switch up your game plan,
'cause shit changed; don’t send a shot that’s way out your range. Damn,
like get this in your brains, fam.
Before you make a Roc(k) round you gotta’ see Ave first;
that’s on the Cave, man(caveman).

Don’t even play if y’all ain’t killers,
'cause you gon' have to be more than sharp for Tay;
you know Roc(k) breaks scissors.

But now that I’m up in the picture, nigga, step to me.
Go ‘head and sleep, but as soon as I catch you restin’, peace.
See I’m that nigga in the East; they was checkin’ for me.
Basically, you get to eat off my flow(floor): I’m Victor Sweet.

Rum-Nitty-vs-Ave-Ave-3
Now that’s where we’re different, geek, 'cause see, I been 'bout that action.
Thirty under the forty, that’s an improper fraction.
I clap whatever pop in his mind,
so you’ll be dead before Smack transform him, first Op to miss(Optimus) Prime.

Never mind, 'cause they don’t need him.
Maybe I can leave him undercover 'til he next to God; I’ll J. Reid him.

Who can’t see him? My flow skill only proves that he’s road kill.
I’ll beat him at his own style with a touch, give it that Rogue feel.

And oh, fuck that punchline belt that they say you hold, queer,
'cause I’ll put a tip to that title(Tidal) like it’s a HOV deal.

I’m so ill. My flow Hell bro,
Shit, I done took plain bars and washed bodies like hotel soap.

I’ll let a shell go, but he ain’t got the heart to be strapped.
Don’t no niggas in Phoenix ring; blame Barkley for that.

I got smokers that clap; nigga, they stay with it.
Told ‘em soon as they see his whip, let that HK hit it,
but I don’t need cash to pay they ticket.
Shit, I can slide a cookie on that car like DayDay did it.

You wanna take a thug’s gamble?
Well understand I’m strapped and fat on both sides, nigga, I love handles.

So fuck beef, 'cause we run to it.
Sign on a pair of Penny's: watch the tongue before you see(C) one(1) through it.

But you ain’t stupid, and you know that if we rumble you out,
so why speak what you don’t want to be 'bout?
Just be humble; don’t go running your mouth,
or you can get a buck fifty up front: I’ll start his own GoFundMe account.

See, they doubt us 'cause we some South hittas.
Well I’m in your cotton picking yard holdin’ my Uncle(') Tom.
Come out the house(,) nigga.

Big mouths get a fucking bum murked up,
'cause I doubt if he hold steel(still) like your son’s first cut.

It’s all a bluff. Y’all buying all this reckless shit he talk?
I mean he ain’t really shooting: he Tom Sheppard in the park.

So put your state on the map and just chill;
keep it rap before that AR is on a (Arizona) nigga back for real.

You see the skill. They kill for the type of shit Ave writes;
I’m John Stockton with a dish to Malone, I’m past(passed) nice.
Make your riders pay bucks up front like a cab price,
so when your team cap(ped) right on the head, that’s draft night,

'cause you bad, right? Cool. Well those shots will get fatal.
Let him run; shit, we ain’t done. Spin the block like a Dreidel.

And we ain’t worried about the jakes, dog; we play raw.
If I don’t feel it’s a big risk(wrist), fuck it: that’s Ray Charles.

But see, y’all support these bluffs,
meanwhile, I got a nigga trying to fight (J)ustice, like Chicago with the brush.

So before you start acting all hype from your Yes man,
just know, life ain’t make you six feet, but death can.

See, you sayin’ shit to fit for the footage,
'cause where I’m from, we’re gon' pull it,
long as it got the firing pins to the bullets.

A high point 40 saved my life; I fell in love with that.
That plastic was popping them rounds, and it weren’t bubble wrap.

But KG claim the West on your back,
but when you shot and end up in a Heavy Bag, thank Kevin for that.

So I hope he brung his chopper, 'cause soon as we done, partner,
niggas get lumped proper; we still owe them one for Hoffa.

Now I ain’t making this no West Side hate,
but if it’s poppin’ shit, then part two, they said Next(,) fry Day(Friday),

'cause I don’t play. That tough shit he saying made up.
Straight fable. You sex on cable: fake fuck,

'cause you talk it like you banging that steel,
but see, I really doubt if B be gunnin'(B.B. gun) unless you thinking like Bill.

See I can punch him to death. Not just with bars though,
my hands is a problem; I’ll leave him lumped up bad as Apollo.
See I ain’t only got to blast him with hollows.
I mean the Bible says, "Thou shall not steal." That’s the only commandment I follow.

I know I’m sinning, lord.
No, *BLAOW*, look who I’m sending, lord.
You'll see a Quarter flipped in the battle, like the beginning, or,

squeeze this round, well I can leave the semi now,
'cause they ain’t getting the prints(prince) like Patrice McDowell.

I got now. I told you fix my plate right Smack?
'Cause they’ve been sleeping, it’s time I bring my state right back.
I don’t give a fuck about these sucka niggas; they type whack.
'Cause I’m a nigga out of Norfolk, straight like that.

RUM NITTY
Shit can get real Ms. Gracie, my nigga.
I know what y’all thinking; wait. y’all thinking weight.
Nah, overkill; two hands over the mil'(meal),
that’s what I was saying(,) Grace.
A headshot in front of a crowd, he’ll go a crazy way,
but giving him the steel in his chest(Chess) really takes the Cake.
For the record, I’ll deal with you, like label mates.
I’m nice; even when I fuck up it’s a dope error(era) like '88.

He be talking like his gun dump,
but won’t say it to the kid. I’ll lift a nine in his face like I’m Nunn Nunn.

You ain’t use your head; think.
Better go watch my last shit again. That’ll make a young nigga fear the Pen;
he'll be scared straight.

I don’t lead waste; I’m only aiming to stretch him.
If I miss you, baby it’s gonna be okay; I got Faith I'ma X him.

Get did bad.
Bullets knock your man’s hat in the streets for talking East/West;
I’ll split you with the fifth, Ave(5th Ave).
Quick bag. The PG never had a shot; don’t be shocked if the kid pass.

Let thirty out the thing.
Saga vs. Chilla: tryin' to make his back slide with a dirty magazine.

But they say his rounds poppin' and I don’t want no trouble with that,
I’m just too damn(two Damme) different like Double Impact.

Facts. One(-)nine’ll clap;
your spine’ll crack from this old Colt. They gon' have to reunite his(Unitas) back.

'Cause I can scrap. Go across his chin, try the left,
or I right(write) shit to flip the script, that’s the Butterfy Effect.

Get ran through. I used to keep a nina on me 'cause I had to,
and on them long nights, Coors Light: shit got cold, the can blew(blue).

But you? On my life, nigga's sweet.
Can’t catch me slippin’; I’ll commit assault(salt) on Ave like it’s ice on the street.

Get stomped out if my squad started.
You’ll have fifty niggas turning up on Ave: that’s a block party,
but he fuck with the law probably,
so I shouldn’t waste my breath on a rat; I ain’t John Coffey.

But niggas blow smoke, no action,
so if he miss a step, the five getting whipped from the belt; I go Joe Jackson.
Pull up gang bangin’, hopping out the four-door flaggin',
and on site(sight) I’ll pick you off like they photo flagged him.

I’m known for that. Mid-battle, a forty clap,
that shit’ll stop Ave dead in a round like a cul-de-sac.

My style belong on Smack. I’m that sure, you dig me?
Y’all remember I'm Gonna Git You Sucka?
Well, me not stepping on the platform is fishy.

And me vers' the niggas you wanna see,
it won’t happen; I come at them, they run from me,
so I can only kill what rap niggas Smack put in front of me,
but first they ain’t want to fuck with me,
and I'd've made it to the stage quicker if I had done a PG or been from the East,

but I battled Rex, Red, Ars, Lotta, Magic.
For me to come to the East and do a PG, that’s backwards,

but I still made it to the stage without that shit,
So facts is, I ain’t earned my respect, I snatched it.

So you can’t put me in that box. I’m sorry.
I done traveled all over the atlas,
but y’all think I’m gonna come back to the Ave and get ran off? I’m not Safari.

The Mac raise, I’m dropping every nigga out the bat cave,
but first it started on the Ave like the old SMACK days.

"New York, New York, big city of dreams." Y’all remember that Snoop shit.
Well I brought in my dog pound and let it kick in the building like Snoop did.

Just worry about the bars and don’t worry what I got on,
but if you is worried, LOMClothing.com.

Bitch I already told him,
I’m 99% gun lines; the other one is the slogan:
Kill yourself.

What you gon' hear today is the mother of all anti-Semitic hate raps.
This is revenge for all the dead children that fell victim from way back.
This here is for every single Arab.
Shit, even the Christians are going to feel like they're getting their payback
once I rape your mother in the ass with no protection,
bare back wearing a Mel Gibson facemask.

You know what rhymes with bar mitzvah?
(Crowd: What?) Swastika.

Let's see where you at, Iron.
Let's see if Solomon can handle this.
Today I'ma put you through some body building championships:
you gon' get pushed to your max(,) Iron.
Straighten out your act here(hair),
‘cause any hot headed shit will get you laid out flat(,) Iron.
Today I'ma run laps around him 'til he get exhausted
and I tire Iron like he had a flat tire,
‘cause he never had drive he just stood on the side and watched me pass by him.
He's past his prime, so ain’t no use for him to come back fighting;
the last time anyone gave a fuck about Iron's mic is when we had Tyson,
so if Iron make a come back for one last time, he gon' get smashed like him

You been pussy since GrizzleMania, ducking and diving,
always playing it about being safe than surviving.
I know you vanished away and take cover so it ain’t no surprise in
that once he takes cover, there ain't no way I'ma find him
‘cause Annie Frank used to guide him,
so I know she told you all the perfect places to hide in.

Yeah, Anne Frank. What a damn skank.
Someone pass me my gas tank.

I am Hitler, the real Heinrich Himmler; sieg heil to your wife and sister.
You've been on two lists your whole life, mine and Schindler’s.

I asked you to battle me the first time, you said no. The second time, you said no.
If you would've flaked this time, it would've been your third right(Reich) in a row.

I said, I thought you would flake. I'm honestly shocked you would take me.
Had me feeling like Pesci all day:
I started sweating, thinking he wouldn't have the balls to face me.

But now that we here Iron, I know who your father is.
You grew off of Little Mermaid royalties
since we were in third grade, you was always rich.
The reason you fell off is this:
it's the work ethic, you never have to work hard for shit. You never starved for shit.
Anything you asked daddy for, you would always get.
See, you that fat guy that walked into the gym, got on a treadmill and jogged a bit,
but you never stayed on it for long enough to even break no body sweat,
so now you stuck in the same plateau you haven't evolved from since,
but use your common sense.
You've been living off a false sense of accomplishment,
‘cause if you worked hard like all us did, you would've not have quit.
You would’ve probably thought of it and realized, "Nah, I worked too hard for this.
I'm Iron Solomon. I'll come back and demolish them.”
Where's your gladiator armor kit, your heart of Spartacus,
your "I am Sparta” shit? Come on, dog, you got this shit.
I'm giving you back all your confidence, you soaking all this in?
You know I normally charge for this.

I'm just saying, you was a legend to all of us,
but when you're in the room, your energy isn't really felt.
Trying to yell your bars to us,
your vocal projection just never hits hard enough
like uh, {snaps fingers} like a Math Hoffa punch.
But where's your voice? Aren't you Jewish? You celebrated so many Hanukkahs
that by now you supposed to have way more presents(presence) than all of us.

We used to call you a pioneer.
You went from that to letting your bitch re-write your third round for Daylyt.
Wait a minute, you let your broad re-write all your hard work and tears?
You take advice from someone else? Wait, y'all don't think this weird?
Honestly, you can call it how you want to call it, but to me all this shit is clear;
Iron Man could never get the job done without someone like Jarvis talking in his ear.
Makes sense you Tony Starks though,
’cause every time you get picked apart in a battle it's back to the lab,
to have your bitch walk around holding up the pad helping you charge up for a year.
That's why Tony Starks is never as solid as he appears;
you've always been in constant fear.
The Iron suit is just an outer part, the center piece is hollow up in here;
Iron Man has had an artificial heart from the start of his career.

Now look at where your life's at.
See, you were fine 'til you tried Smack, but you can't deny facts,
that if Iron himself had that type of endurance, then he might last,
but he left too much of a wide gap
where he didn't focus on his time, on his rhyme craft,
so if you paid more attention in science class,
you would know that Iron becomes rusty when you let too much time pass.

These bars I drop got knowledge in 'em.
Darwinism: Charles Dickens versus non-fiction DNA mama level autism,
plus, your father scripted all of Oscar The Grouch's shit for Sesame Street
So now I know where you enherit all your garbage writtens.
Yeah, you fell off, you got to admit it.
You should've move to New Orleans and got an apartment to live in
with a bunch of tsunami victims
so you can share stories all day about how you're washed up with 'em.

This is God’s gifted. I’m God gifted.
Watching me spit is like a game of Twister,
’cause I can catch bodies back to back with my skills on the spot,
and that's the reason you got us all twisted.

I mean, you the best freestyler? Explain how.
Yo, back in the day,
if you didn't recycle so much you wouldn't even have a name now,
and I'm gonna explain how,
you know the, "you're behind on California time" you told TheSaurus?
That was the second time you recycled those same rounds.
Let's play a game of “I Swear” now.
Say, “I swear on my newborn child,
I didn't use those lines in a battle with Okwerdz that never came out.”
Look at his face now.

You look like you just got caught in a stupid lie.
You have a better chance of getting Sasha Cohen
to show up here dressed up as Borat in a suit and tie,
‘cause that's the only way this crowd gon’ get to see
another Arab get played by a Jewish guy.

I'm trying to get y'all to see, that's he's the fakest freestyler that’s on the scene,
but y'all don't see it.
Y'all just obsessed with these little pussies like a bunch of Carter Deems.
He's a dead man walking; he's almost in his coffin, he's just caught in between.
He got one window to get outside of this box he’s in;
I got him inside of a laundry machine.
And that's the irony(Iron, he) in it, ‘cause even if Iron makes it out of it clean,
all it means is me and Iron still got to iron out some things,
I mean, we gon' get right down to the tee.
Even if you don't like how it seems(seams),
if he don't tell me what his true religion is...
fuck it, I'ma find out when he gets {punches air} right out of his jeans.
How was that? How was that for an ironing theme?
Or, I got a different type of Iron scheme.
I'll take an Iron Fist to Iron’s cheek like the Iron Sheik,
and you wouldn’t dare fight me inside the ring.
I wish he would try me; even if I tried him, he wouldn't try a thing.
Even if Iron was Tiger Woods you wouldn't see Iron swing.

But you'll probably rap about Math for three rounds.
If you do, then be prepared to throw hands with me now.
If you did, it would be like the Shazaam app: you’ll quickly catch a beat down.

I don't give a fuck if you think I'm emotional, bitch.
If you've been acting tough like Andy Dump,
we can go outside and box over this shit.

I'm about to hit him with the fucking closer, ‘cause I don't care.
Kill yourself, ‘cause even if you did, people would probably still won't care.
Take your Spring Fever CD, walk through a black hole,
get lost in the middle of nowhere,
and don't forget to take Adam Sandler
and all his gay ass movies with you when you go there.

IRON SOLOMON
Oh, fuck. I made my own bed;
when I was dormant, I gave y'all reason to snooze on me.
Tonight, we putting that to rest. Y'all still sleeping, then you zombies.
What you'll see is a true homi,t hat looks like lipo to you prob’ly,
‘cause he's gonna suck, and I'ma get a new body.

This throne is my home, I came back for the upkeep.
Retard strength: all your battles are dumb weak.
This quack will be duck meat for flapping too much beak;
I'm doing my numbers on the web: duck feet.
If you fucked The Saurus's mother, forty-some weeks
before The Saurus was born, you couldn't compete(cum Pete).

If you wouldn't come east, I'd come confront him in the west.
I'd throw hands across America; every fucking punch connects.
You a one and done at best, I'm the one who done it best.
Big killers sleep in a guillotine: a cut above the rest.

I'm the recoil that'll leave your gun hand crushed.
True artist, I paint pictures with a drum and brush.
I'm the one man band that ?uestlove can't touch,
serve food for Thought like The Roots front man's lunch.
Do You Want More?!!!??!
Your Halflife starts once Organik/Organix flips the coin,
’cause that's When Things Fall Apart,
and this is just The Tipping Point for now, brother.
I'ma milk this; my style butter. The crowd love me like the cow's utter in Calcutta.

The savior. The Christians praying to Jesus(Spanish pronunc.);
to Jews I am Moses. To Pagans, I’m they Zeus.

Walk the crowd like the holy ghost strolling through the convent.
You can smell Jehovah's odor on me; I am God-sent(scent).

You will never see me lose to this old Lebaneser Scrooge.
They booked a death machine for you. I suggest you think it through;
You'll get digested, eaten, chewed; you a recipe for food.
Step inside the lion's den, you don't get to leave the zoo.

A different pedigree than you; that's why I would like to question,
what did you bring to the game? What makes this guy some type of legend?
Working twenty years on his precise refined impression
of Eminem’s exact style from 1997?
This Afgan a Stan. Such a-rabid(Arab) fan,
your whole style’s cut from someone else's cloth: you Dapper Dan.

With a master plan to spit some multi-syllable shit
to distract the fans while you spit some old silly bullshit.

Get out the kiddie pool, Diz. You supposed to be an adult.
You keep getting old, but we don't seem to see the results.

You're just a Lost Boy, Peter Pan whose punchlines Never Land;
when D's in bad form, he needs a Hook to get a hand.

I mean for real, what's this guy's problem? Tinkerbell is what I call him.
He got dusted, and did some fairy shit to keep the light on him.

"I want views like Fetty Wap to get the blind to see,
I(eye) only got to sock it(socket) to get where I should be."

Lash out and patch it up, nothing's cornier(cornea).
What you've become gave battles astigmatism: disappointed at what my pupil's done.

In hindsight, the Bay Watched you hassle Hoffa(Hasselhoff) for limelight,
and this guy's hype off of that surprise fight like that's a prize fight.

Even though we know you only go to blows if it's staged right,
the irony, that this homophobe's fans support gay rights.

Had your people riding the benches, jumped right in the trenches.
You got some grimy intentions with you inside of these legends.
See to me, turning battles into fights is just senseless,
but cross the line, this battle will bare a striking resemblance.

‘Cause I’m a wig splitter, I'm a ditch digger, I’m a shit kicker and I'm a bit bitter.
You a quick pitcher; I'm a big swinger. Won't be the one running; I'm a pinch hitter.
Fans of Diz figure I’d get disfigured? Fuck you! This(dis) finger.
If y'all keep it a hundred, then it'll be a 3-0. That's six figures.

But since homie's a clown, I might throw my third round, ‘cause I want to sock ya.
So if I beat this pussy ass, 2-1, it's not a shocker.
I will bow, bow, Waka Flocka. Better call a doctor
when lick a shot in your noodle: penne a la vodka.

And when I'm done kicking your ass, we gon' kick it at Brass Rail.
There's a chick with a fat tail that be sending me fan mail.

Them hoes aren't playing. See everybody knows our name,
‘cause I be tossing paper like I'm trying to expose Arcane.

Round Two
DIZASTER
Alright so, you brought up the Math fight of course,
and I think it's awesome for you to reference,
and I think it's really awesome for you to mention.
No, honestly bro, thank you for putting your two cents in.
Are you sure it's not too expensive?
I know for you, being a Jew, that's kind of a huge investment.

You fucking chubby, chunky, southern, country, Humpty Dumpty
looking, fucking, ugly, musty, Dusty Rhodes, Tele-tubby,
Barney Rubble body double, Bubba Dudley cuddle buddy.

Fucking loser. This guy is like Allen Iverson:
He could've been the G.O.A.T. but he fucked up most of his chances,
and that's the difference between the Kobe's and the Jordan's and Magic’s,
the ones that stayed in the game, and gave you more and more classics,
and the ones that eventually fell off,
‘cause they always thought they were too good
to show up to court for their practice.
I know we appear like we're closely matched, but our roads don't overlap; when
I kept on moving forward and past ‘em,
you hit the fork in the road and went backwards.
We both started off as the total package,
and then you dipped into the lower bracket,
came back below the average of the normal standards;
all it took was a little four-year absence
and you became a former has-been like Toni Braxton.
You put in all this work to record these albums
that most fans in battle rap don't download no tracks from;
the other half don't even notice you enough to even know you had one.
This must be what it feels like to be Latoya Jackson.
Plus, I got another question I've been wanting to ask him:
Do you rap while you're doing home gymnastics?
Do you put your notepad down on your yoga mattress?
And you perform the dances like your multisyllabics,
how you cover the graphics so overdramatic,
like an HBO crime scene show reenactment.
Bro, you're a faggot.


Photo by Christian Andrabado for BattleRap.com.
Doctors done fucked you up with a lot of medication, bro, and you got no more skill,
can't get back to his normal self ‘cause he don't even know how normal feel.
Quick, someone toss Jonah Hill another Soma pill so he can focus still,
‘cause he's looking real shaky on film like Cloverfield.
But anyways, how's that studio going though? You recording still? Bro, you're ill.
Still working towards that recording deal? You'll make it. I know you will.
‘Cause what you gon' do? Survive off your Fight Klub days?
Nobody even remembers those older rounds.
The only thing we remember from Fight Klub is, "Yo, hold it down! Hold it down!"
That's how annoying your fucking host would sound.

Or who else remembers his battles from the Hall of Fame?
When you went off the top with a dude with his top off;
who remembers Iron Solomon versus Flamez?
Yeah, he got the W right? But him in that battle and the holocaust were the same,
‘cause it wasn't no surprise to see the Jewish guy bodying(body in) Flamez.
Burn and you get burned in the game; burn, I'll burn you with flames.
Shit, even Bernie Sanders has the word "burn" in his name.

Now you're in a dead zone where no one enters. *Pop, pop* goes the heckler.
Go against me, and your physical form dismembered.
You won't be able to use your legs or arms again,
like Denzel Washington when he starred in the Bone Collector.

Your father built you an in-house studio
to record your records and get your stuff done,
but it's fucked up, ‘cause you can't have black people come over,
‘cause, "Son, we don't trust them."
Gets all awkward every time he has black folks recording over
and he comes into the room and confronts them
like, "Haha, so, Young Gunz. ..Where do you know my son from?"

All that matters when they view this back is who could rap,
so where are all my goons from Fallujah at?
In the streets letting bazooka's and Ruger's clap,
Uzi's, Mac's with the new attachments;
I got Halo from-the-future gats, huger straps than the one's Duke Nukem has.
*Boom, boom*, shoot ya ass, hadouken flash, *boom, boom, chilaka boom* ya ass.
I don't give a fuck. *Boom, boom*, North Korea nuclear blast,
I'll reduce you to ash with a nuke. A nuke and ash.
What's that? Dude, that's Nash, you stupid ass.
Yo, my resume is like a fucking cemetery, full of piles of humans stacked,
‘cause I done caught more overseas bodies than a Cuban raft.
If white boy got a nine, then he can get schooled with that,
get it? ‘Cause we're from two different schools; he a junior high school student.
I'm a fully developed uni-grad; I’m too advanced for you to grasp.
You Columbine popping nines; I'm a Virginia Tech going off on students campus,
which means me and you are not in the same shooting class.
You know what I'm saying, dog? Plus my newest strap
got a built in Mac computer that
keeps all of your vehicle movement's tracked like an Uber app,
could open up your location on Google Maps;
see you in the window, then I zoom in fast,
shoot your ass through the glass, spill your medulla on the Isuzu dash,
and the people that are moving past
will scream, "Help, someone just killed the fat kid from Superbad!"
And I don't give a fuck who you have.
Bring your goons for backup, then it's AngryFan movements: I'm only using caps.
I'll put you and all your fruity ass
dogs together in the same bag like a pack of Scooby Snacks.
And if you come back from the dead, I'ma put a giant round in the back of your head
like one of your stupid looking Jewish hats.
I'll body everything in the room, moving like I'm Supernat.
Leave me alone before I blow a fuse and snap, like a fuselage with a fuse attached.
You'll get your fucking right socket removed and snatched,
get your eyeball turned to a wounded gash.
The next interview you do with Vlad,
you'll be on the couch telling stories with one of your pupil's patched:
Slick Rick The Ruler's back.
When I say "Turn up,” I mean turn up to the max.
I mean turn him to a vegetable;
you seen the movie Expendables? Well I'll put you in a cast just has huge as that.

(Pussy. And you have pink eye.)

IRON SOLOMON
*clapping* Good for you, Diz. You got Pat Stay's formula down,
and your formula down.
I mean, you pack sixty seconds with enough bars for a four minute round,

and you make it work, it’s this crazy blur of rhyming schemes and hateful words
that you vomit out your mouth like you're trying to feed a baby bird.
At some point you got a diss line for me, or maybe Eurgh;
a crowd reaction distracts him, he shouts “faggot!” and a bunch of racial slurs,

just hoeing and yapping when he's supposed to be rapping.
Acting like you got ovaries and over reacting,

so we can just guess what's next, from slugfests to gun threats.
This chump went from throwing temper tantrums to throwing up(-)sets,
choked out Billy, now he feel he's a roughneck.
Been on 52 cards; got more attention from one deck.
Looking like a junky that don't have any drugs left,
you either need to catch up on rest or have a blood test,

‘cause the effects of crack and coke are what Dizaster don't consider.
You got deeper into some yay(‘ye) shit than Amber Rose's fingers.
If you see this addict twitching like he can't control his temper,
it's been half a minute since he had a chance to post on Twitter.

I mean, I'm just trying to diagnose all of this clown's symptoms.
Charron's autistic, but you've got I-Want-To-Be-Down Syndrome.

The type of lost nerd who wants to be hip hop so bad, just to fit in
he got the Microsoft Word graffiti font tattooed on his skin.

And what's under that mountain of ink, you need to talk about to a shrink,
but there's a lot smarter people in this crowd than you think.
We hear the contradictory shit out of your mouth when you speak,
how you call Pat Stay a racist, then call Dumbfoundead a chink.


Photo by Dan Gibs for KOTD.
Told Hoffa, "stop eating fried chicken”. Har-dee-har.
That's as funny as the n-word with a hard E-R.
So go on and recite all them bars you can write bout the holocaust in one night,
call me a kike, and a bunch of shit I'm sure Caustic will like,
(Thanks for the heroin, dog.)

it's a strong strategy, Diz. Say it with audacity. Get loud, talk rapidly;
the crowd will all laugh at me,
but if that exposes the bigots, then I'll take the fall happily.
You think racism is hip hop? You buying the wrong rap CD’s.

Under our skin, we the same color. Don't believe it, then fight me.
Do it! You'll see you're just like me when you get beat to the white meat!

Or maybe Iron Sol' vers’ Iron Shiek is what all of you wanted,
Muhammad Ali versus Ali Muhammad.

Well that worked pretty well; I’ma make me some racist remarks now.
Your peoples eat pita, you were raised to be making these soft rounds.

We ate motza when we fled from Egypt, we went missing,
where the heat of the desert, where the stones were our best kitchen,
and the food’s hard texture stemmed from that existence.
What I'm saying is, going back generations, we bred(bread) different.

Our religious text gave us ambition; your clan's missing.
2000 years before Muslims, our Bible was handwritten.
Y'all changed Abraham to Ebrahim and ran with that transcription;
the Torah is the O.G., the Quran is just fan faction.

Boy, you done picked a bad Jew to attack.
You know how many MC's I ran through for a rack?

Your integrity's out of wack.
Look around the room, faces from everywhere on the map.
Our bond is rap; you should honor that,
but every card he act(cardiac) like he's serious as a heart attack,
but got to lean on shock value to bring a body back.

This preacher testifies just to keep you mesmerized;
you can't see through his disguise, need to reconnect your eyes.
I mean Jesus effing Christ, every freaking single rhyme
like a Lebaneser mime in, uh, Lethal Weapon 5,
and in your egotistic mind you believe in every lie,
so we may never get to see this style you beat to death just die.
Exposing D's deception gets him peeved in every line;
I'm making this pussy tight. This a kegel exercise.

See people recognize this Dizaster character’s not you.
You had a Halloween party where rappers battled in costume.

You made them stay in fake persona instead of going off real life,
so you won't have to be the only one who knows what that feels like.

See, he'll strike when he steps out of his lane and gets bold(bowled),
But you ain't really from the gutter, you just playing a role(roll).
So please, spare us. Spare us.

You ain't cooking coke; you ain't never seen the hood befo’.
You sweeter than a Tootsie Roll wrapped up in some cookie dough,
shoved inside a pussy hole of a virgin playing footsie toe.
Your Gjonaj battle is the only time you pushed an O.

And when you fucked up that jelly fish line, what Dizaster revealed up here
is what you mean to yell in your rhymes isn't actually real, it's clear.

See I'm a Man o’ War; when I'm on a sting, your death's been sealed.
My line's lead up to a body, I tend to kill(tentacle).

Yo, I flew here to get the mileage; you flew here to get demolished.
What they paid you pays your rent; I'm 'bout to put my kid through college.

If you take away the hype, all the hate and spite,
just to lose to Mook, they gave me twice what you got paid tonight.

My status may have fell, but when our checks coming through,
you'll see that even when I take an L, I get double you(W).

Yeah, I went over with Lyt, but tonight I'll respect time;
I said I'd kill you with three minutes, and we right at the deadline.

Round Three
DIZASTER
Now this guy.. really has pink eye.
Back off, ‘cause I don't want to be in front of you, you fricking disgrace.
You've already had it happen to you once,
don't make me rub some more shit in your face.

Here comes a guy whose career died a long time ago,
in the year 3 King of the Dot B.C., 500 Grind Time's ago,
comes a guy from the biased coast,
who's about to get all of his stripes revoked like Spider Loc.
See, you said this in one of the lines you wrote:
that the doctors prescribed you the same drugs as Michael.
Okay, that means you need all kinds of dope just so your fucking mind can cope,
so know, if you had the chance to be the straw that broke the camel's back,
you would use it to sniff a line of coke.
Ever since Mook, your career been on a declining slope.
It's like Gary Coleman's last episode alive; that’s a double meaning line:
if you take the name of his show, title and the way he died and combine them both,
then you finally know why this is his final Stroke.
Your fucking music career is one big giant Heimlich choke.
You should've known with an album like Monster you would wind up broke.
It's all in your bio; didn't see a single sell(cell) from it, or multiply in growth,
since your career was under the spotlight of the microscope.
What, do I gotta break it down in a science course or something?
Iron divides into four different types of isotopes,
which could explain why
you spent half of your life on the shelf trying to blow, but Iron won’t.
See a lot of elements become radio(-)active after their half-life, but Iron don’t,
which is why he's a normal Iron I suppose,
‘cause all the deals they had for him on the table folded,
and they never got Iron closed(clothes).

That's why you're hanging by a thread now, on life support.
You fucking got beat down in front of Mook until you couldn't fight no more,
which makes you the worst type of whore,
the one that gets fucked once and quits cause her vagina's sore.
You should fucking kill yourself. Plus, you violated as far as the guy code goes.
I provided you guided roads where ever your drive go; I gave you the Geico quotes.
The greatest of all time, the Michael Jordan of this entire sport,
a satanic shrine logo: I(eye) am the goat(G.O.A.T).
The messiah, the Eye of Horus, the Ayatollah to your diaspora,
I am your righteous Lord; I am your most high, like a white boy’s FICO score.
I am like Michael Koors,
‘cause I can catch a big bag and still have a lot of time in store,
Get it? A big bag and still have a lot of time in store?
I'll hit you with a thousand lines like a Miley Cyrus tour.
This is what Michael Moore would look like in his final form.
I know you gon' reference the five days in Egypt,
but trust me, this ain't that kind of war;
this is more like fighting Thor inside of a lightning storm.

I go Psycho Michael Myers with a knife inside a psych ward,
or cycle Slo-Niacin: good night you, bro.
I'll put you to sleep in your own language:
I'll “laila tov” you. Yeah, this Diet Rone is gonna die alone.
All it takes is one solid bar and he's a washed up body; punchlines are like Dial soap.
Dynamo. You trying to fight a robot cyborg from Biocorps;
we'll find you inside your home,
beside your phone, with your vital signs synchronized with the dial tone:
*bleeep*
Who gives a fuck if N.Y. is a no flying zone? I got Palestine inside my bones.
I'll hit you with a rock in your face from a couple kilometers away;
that's what I call reaching a milestone.

You will die from my pen stroke like Death Note, if it's written form we battle.
Freestyle, I'll son(sun) you off the top like solar panels,
and I got more examples.
No matter how many menorah lamps you have, you’ll never hold a candle
to the levels of pressure I was born to handle.
You know why? ‘Cause you don't have no souls or backbones.
Bro, you don't even know your past, bro.
Real Jews were Hebrews, black men who used to grow their afros.
You guys, are just a bunch of fucking random phony Polish assholes

who forged your passports, and don't have a land of your own,
so you come over and they jack yours,
but what is it all for? Is it drilling off shore? Is it the land, or do you want more?
See, Arabs, we’re peaceful, bro; you can come to my house.
I'd invite you in. Take the keys to my car, the garage door.
I just want you to feel comfortable at home,
since you're used to occupying households that are not yours.

I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
Organik was trying to get him and Hollow Da Don popping off.
They had an investor from his side ready to put up all the gwap;
made all these excuses at the end why it ended up falling off,
but the real reason we did not see(Nazi) it
is because Solomon's people couldn't afford what Hollow cost(holocaust).
I ain't anti-Semitic. Knock it off
before I go durka durka, allahu akbar on him and start letting rockets off,
dropping bombs and launching tomahawks.
I got a lot of fire bottled up like a walking Molotov.
I'm a blacksmith: I'll put an Iron bar on the chopping block.
I don't give a fuck if it's shalom shabbat or shabbat shalom,
I'll punch you in the face and leave your glasses broken on the floor; mazel tov.
You battled Mook on Smack and we watched you fall.
You let a mark(Marc) ass brother outshine you, take your spot; you Pau Gasol.
And that's when you got on some Bull shit and you dropped the ball.
Now everyone knows you was that one cat
with a giant pussy in his lap like Marley Marl.
This the army of God. Think the ending of every Inspector Gadget, ‘cause all you saw
was me putting a metal arm to this cat's head like Doctor Claw.
I know a little bit of Krav Maga.

Fucking twist your father into a arm bar, knock his fucking yamaka off.
Fuck it, if me and Iron brawl I'm knocking out anybody involved,
*boo boppity bow*, stand over your head like all of the stars.
I’m off the hook with these hands; people call me Kabal.
I’ll move at light speed as I proceed to break my right knee off in your jaw.

Fuck a gun bar. Fuck a gun bar. I'm creative; I don't need one at all.
I'll swing a fucking Pirates Of The Caribbean claw,
cut you in half with it like a seesaw, send the blade flying clean through the wall,
watch it come out the other side of the street
and kill five people that weren't even involved.

I'm like a evil Peter Parker that delivers people karma,
with a side order of beef kebab for starters.
Fucking with me’s retarded like asking Sweeney Todd to be your barber.
I'm a evil Tamil Tiger guerrilla fighter from Sri Lanka,
followed you to your job and I’m camped outside of your job
and I can't wait for you to leave the office like Stephen Harper.
Yeah. You think you can relate to Canadians more than me?
(Hahaha.) Bro, you are more pussy than a Weeknd concert.
Even the concept of you beating me here in Toronto couldn't be more farther
than the thought of Stevie Wonder being able to see his daughter.

I'll fucking let the Glock sleep him,
put him in an armbar ’til he stops breathing
like Eric Gardner when the cops beat him.
Pay attention, that's a double bar meaning.
I mean either way, you gon' die from arm squeezing.

They hated us ever since the World Trade got hit.
And they blamed us with all this bullshit, but what the media don't say is this.
How many of your people didn't show up to work that day
‘cause they claimed they were sick?
Or the Zionist banker who took out the insurance claim and then split?
Explain to me this: how a national tragic event could make your people rich,
or how a bunch of cavemen in Afghanistan
could penetrate the world's most sophisticated defense,
and have these monolithic beams that are encased in cement
all cut at the precise angle you need a buildings foundation to sit?
It's ‘cause you motherfuckers orchestrated the shit
and used the media as a tool to blame us swit wit—
To blame us swit wit? Or blame us with?
But it don't matter, because you blamed the desert for taking those plane flights,
but it's clear as daylight(Daylyt) that you staged that shit.

And you only have one ball. I mean, it's all good, bro.
Don't be mad ‘cause the doctor slashed your wontons and you can't get a hard-on.
You can still be the champ of any track you hop on, even with half your balls gone.

You could ask Lance Armstrong. You can still be successful; it doesn't change it all.
Look, you can ask Tom Brady, dog;
you can still make it in the game with a deflated ball.

I know, I know. I bet that little ball of his at night gets lonely.
Sitting in bed, he felt a trickle going down his leg slowly.
Thought he pissed on himself;
it turned out to be his right nut pouring out liquor for his dead homie.
(He has one fucking ball; he can't fuck with me.)

This is the path toward the end, so listen and pay attention,
’cause all your people ever did was scrutinize us.
My people are true survivors.
And you used the media as a way to oppress us,
and generation after generation you try to euthanize us,
then we turn into revolution fighters,
but what would you do if you was in the street seeing them kill women
and execute their minors?
Shooting your child in his back,
how could you justify seeing a two year old
with a tank on his back like a scuba diver?
*Spits, arabic word, spits*
Who grew Al Qaeda? You grew Al Qaeda. You guys are fueling ISIS.
This ain't no war on terrorism; this is a Zionist Jewish crisis,
a bunch of fucking greedy bankers who have no value for what human life is.
If you ever see an Arab group of snipers,
just know that's from weapons that you provide us,
so we can kill each other and you can use it as an excuse to crucify us,
but not now, not now. I'ma flip out. Bro, who defines us? Who's the finest?
What am I doing? I'm losing my mind, bitch.
Give me this shit, al these fools should like this.
I don't give a fuck what I'm gonna do, ‘cause this dude's the nicest.
(*Puts on a Hitler moustache and starting rapping in fake German*)
Hooten feinstich, hooten feinstich.
Fuck it, it dropped off and a fusten tagen,
Barbra Streisand und foosten tragen.
Roosten tagen a roost a da hoosten dragen,
Seth Rogan ... Adam Sandler … Shia Labeouf … roosten tagen.
(*Then spits a few bars in Lebanese. Translation courtesy of our Arabic-speaking friends; if we've messed anything up, please let us know in the comments.*)
"Who do you (Jews) think you are?
You're full of yourselves because America defends you,
but you keep attacking the Palestinians because they have no one to defend them
but Hezbollah, and you stay really far from them,
because every time you get near Hezbollah you get fucked up.
I'll fuck your mother, you son of a bitch. Suck a dick.
Fuck all your people and the people that birthed your God."

IRON SOLOMON
So, y'all wanna know the real reason that we had problems in Grind Time?
It w-it was- uh.. shit, me too. Might've been all in this guy's mind.
I mean, when I picture what was at stake and follow the timeline,
D was only beefing because I was in my prime,

‘cause we had never met before. They had rappers on every floor,
and you paid Kap Kallous to book my room next to yours.
Since you don't know the difference between real life and a messageboard,
you trolled the hallway all day posted up on my bedroom door.

The whole weekend you followed me, no drama or static,
then hopped on camera in your battle, and you called me a faggot,

and I'll never forget this, with Pumpkinhead as my witness,
you ran right out of the ring to me and begged for forgiveness.

It was awkward, and kind of just weird,
offered to buy me a beer, talking right in my ear,
apologizing for years about a line that Bashir
took time to prepare that I didn't hear,
‘cause I wasn't watching your battle, ‘cause I didn't care.

See, between love and hate, there's a thin line, but for Diz, no disconnect.
So everybody that Diz respects becomes someone he disrespects,

from the indirects to the blatant hate. In your Twitter rants you’ve discussed me,
but you're on my dick the second we're face to face,
trying to give me dap. You disgust me.

With your rants and your ten page speeches,
talking junk about Smack more than an N.A. meeting.

If you and URL's relationships something you can't repair,
you know what a real gangster would do? Just not battle there.
(What's wrong with King Of The Dot? You know what I'm saying?)

You hate the east coast ‘cause we never gave you support?
We gave you hip hop culture, Diz; we gave you this sport.
The way that you walk, your dress code, the slang that you talk.
You from the Fresh Coast? Son, the word "fresh" came from New York.

You pull your iPhone out your pocket in battles; awesome example
of how all of the raps that you spit, you got from the Apple.

Y'all know his note section’s just a pad full of writtens.
So what, it's cool to do that now, ‘cause Canibus did it?

You such a hip hop purist, how's that such a crutch you still rely on?
We seen Diz cell out in battles more than Malathion.

You call street rappers phone(-)y but your gun bars be dialed out;
it's like you can't get a line out without a nine now.

The principles he been talking, we don't ever see him walking.
It's all theory; you don't really stand for shit: you Stephen Hawking.

It's so feeble. Flint, Michigan tap water: your flow's lethal,
but only because the poison you fed 'em misled your own people.

You're not a terrorist; you're a tourist, a gimmick,
pointing your fingers at our flaws like a critic to hide your fraudulent image.
The real perpetrator's you, but you don't want to admit it;
you're like the coward who killed Cyrus and said The Warriors did it.

Oh, you.. fucking.. hypocrite. You whore for attention. You exhibitionist.
You preach, but you don't practice, give a speech and contradict the shit.

Overdoser, coke in the nose, emotional roller coaster,
you opportunist, you Brutus, Judas you culture vulture!
I hate you. I hate you, but it's my fault,

‘cause I stepped out of this ring, and turned my queen to my ex wifey,
and I prayed her new suitor would be a king who was just like me.

I walked away from this woman who was the love of my life,
and I can't stand that her new man just ain’t fucking her right.

See, when you was still trying to steer through the bottom tier,
and the future of battle rap was not as clear, I was here.
Been a pioneer the entirety of my career.
I made this backpack shit take off: I'm the Rocketeer.

I spelled out this path to give y'all some direction,
put myself on the map, so you could follow the legend.

What I deserve I achieve, with just a verse and a beat.
I didn't work for a fee and what I earned wasn't free.
Went on a murdering spree, hit every curb in the street,
when it was 30 degrees I was still burning MC’s.
In terms of this league, my words and my schemes are the birds and the bees;
the sperm and the seeds, what emerged was this league.
So you're the MC you are because you were birthed from my breed.
I didn't quit and come back; I took paternity leave.
I fathered your whole existence, Diz. You learned this from me,
then played the role of an heir you're unworthy to be.

You're not Solomon reborn. You've been keeping my seat warm,
a dis(Diz)figured version of me that's how D formed(deformed),

and the Commodore and Eli might seem like a lovely option,
’til you realize, in real life what it feels like without Nucky Thompson.

Let Diz, Pat and Mac scrap for seconds and thirds.
Who gives a fuck about runners up now that the best has returned?

My last battle was a classic. Now Don't Flop has thrown me in the fucking ditch,
‘cause I don't wanna seem sexist, yet he's only given me another bitch.
(Nothing? Fine.)

Fuck you, Mister Grist! I don't like your lessons no more.
All you talk about is how my attendance is poor,
and you've been on my case more so than ever before,
so I'll give you a left to the jaw if you ever report whatever you saw,
and if I get expelled, be assured that you're getting some more.

You see Mixy as your companion, and you think that he's your buddy,
‘cause you've both got master’s degrees in dick-related studies,
and, yeah, you might have good holidays and be swimming in the money,
but with all that marking you have to do, I bet you wish you was a dummy.
(Mark-ing, you know?)

But hold up, Mixy, I'm taking the mick, see?
You could mix E in my drink and still could never lick me.
I'll make Mix see that the dead poets are history;
I’m like the tenth Olympian, and you're a motherfucking pixie.

When punchlines hit Mark Grist, I know they will mark Grist;
your name is a grain, so of course I'll tear apart Grist.

And I don't care about Dead Poets’ dead poetry;
after this you'll be a corpse under a dead poet tree.

Blizzard-vs.-Mark-Grist-2-Blizzard
I'm always on the ball; I should be back-heeling.
I won't stop rapping ’til my hands peeling,
and this guy gets sacked for his bad teaching.
If I get gully, you'll feel a pain in your back region;
smashed glass, pain in your back region,
then you'll know what it's like to be on the wrong side of a glass ceiling.

I heard teacher versus student battle, and I wasn't going to class;
I get to battle that nerdy bastard who failed at controlling the class.

You knob-head, I hope you drop dead.
If I punch you in the face, who are you gonna call, Ofsted?

MARK GRIST
To those at home who are sitting, watching YouTube, don't start clicking;
I know this might look like some kind of extreme babysitting.
It's actually a rap battle, two grown men lyrically bitching,
just one of us isn't legally old enough to drink inside the building.

And now, Bradley's gonna try and act less infantile,
by pretending that he's proper riled,
so sit back, watch him reconcile with his lack of breastfeeding as a child.

That's why this ugly duckling’s suckling from the teat of any bumpkin
with a beat; all means of dumping his meaningless shit on something.
And the speed of words you're mumbling hides the fact they don't mean nothing.
He may have beat the witch from Oz, but it's time for me to teach this Munchkin.

You will never amount to somebody, and I'm here to raise a grievance.
“Big up everyone whose parents have property in Manchester,”
mate, that's not a fucking achievement.
This Blizzard lizard's got no fire; it's just hot air he's breathing.
When all's said and done, as the years drag on,
you'll look even more like Deborah Meaden.

This rapper's pint-sized; he's cock-eyed.
When he raps, his mouth only actually moves on one side.
He's like a pre-pubescent Popeye,
complete with physique that implies that all the spinach in the world has died.

And look at him try, this poor little chap, like so many anemics I've seen in my class,
dreams of riding up high on a unicorn's back,
while defending the world from an Orcish attack.
You wank off in sandals
to pictures of Gandalf you stack with the mags in your porn stash.
He's got a hard-on for wizards; he only called himself Blizzard
‘cause that's the company that made World of Warcraft.

Round Two
BLIZZARD
Every bar you've ever spat was a sack of pig shit.
They say that words are weapons; then you must be pacifistic.
I've hated you since the day I first heard you; I was antagonistic,
and this next round is gonna be fucking painful like it's masochistic.

It doesn't take much for me to tell you that you're lame.
That's why you've gotta(got a) die like a board game.

You're trying to act like you're the boss of Don't Flop, like you're Rowan,
acting like you're all-seeing and all-knowing,
but you're in a canoe with no paddles, bitch; it looks like you're rowing,
and I'm gonna get rid of Mark like when Germany brought the Euro in.
(I'll come back to you in a sec, yeah? Don't worry, man.)

Fuck anyone that said my battle with H-Bomb was a stroke of luck.
I just hated being a laughing stock, now I couldn't give a sugar-coated fuck.
I'm feeling drunk off disrespect now, and I've got no plans to sober up.
The same guys that sent me death threats now want to hold my nuts.

The battlers that name-dropped me? I'm scaring ‘em with ease.
I'm an embarrassing pain to them like a venereal disease.
So bring up all your fiction, man, I dare you, do it, please,
‘cause you only talk gas, Mark, on various degrees.

So wave to the camera; you haven't got any hope.
You might as well look up to the sky and ask God for the rope.
It's like I'm looking at JFK's head from an optical scope:
you're the dead president, and I won't stop til you slope.

This battle journey's been insane. Peace, Eurgh, it's still taking me on a trek,
yet this guy's music couldn't even feed him a cheque,
so escape the premises, bitch; you better leave in a sec
before I turn your little classroom into Peterborough Tech.

MARK GRIST
Bradley's last battle showcased his innate ability to hurl abuse at women,
and it was so impressive, that I thought that I might mimic him.

A funny thing, online you whinge that your Mum saw your last battle accidentally?
Well I hate to chat crap behind anyone's back, so why not address her directly?

Mrs. Green, Mrs. Green, please move into the screen;
I’ve got some people behind me I'm sure that you've seen.
Gentlemen, say hello to Mrs. Green.

You may not believe me, but you've actually met most of them;
I mean there wasn't much light; you were at a lower height,
kinda slobbering like a doberman.
Those nights out gathering STD’s, while Bradley stayed in collecting Pokemon,
and you beat him by a landslide, ‘cause he only collected most of them.

Mrs. Green, Mrs. Green,
that froth from between your maw’s jaws
dribbles more than an entire football team.

When you sit down, it sounds like a sea lion applauding.
Not many women insert a life-jacket before a young man comes a-boarding.
Every morning, noon and night, those juices they are pouring
’til your thighs, when spread wide, resemble laminate flooring.

Blizzard-vs.-Mark-Grist-2-Mark
Mrs. Green, Mrs. Green, your son's thoughts are obscene;
the truth is you live in his every wet dream.

A seventeen-year-old Oedipus, he fantasizes about each of us,
climaxing more heavily upon you than an Eastenders omnibus.

That's why I'm here to stop this depravity,
point out how wrong it is, the seriousness, the gravity,
explain that more rubber gets burned in your vaginal cavity
than the combined alacrity of every Formula One engine battery.

I'm so sorry about about you, Mrs. Green, and I'm so sorry about Bradley;
I'm doing my best to help him, but he just keeps on trying to attack me.
I'd be pretty pissed off, but he's doing it really fucking badly.

Round Three
BLIZZARD
I didn't come here for my assessments, Mister Grist;
I came for my rapping endeavors,
so don't you dare think of correcting my grammatical errors.

And we know now you're a teacher, so that needs no further explanation,
but I'm smarter than you think, let me recap on my education.

In Nursery, I was a terror; I made everyone's experience hell.
The only noise that I enjoyed hearing: the bell.

Temper tantrums every day; I used to walk out of the room.
Thirteen years later, I'm here making mountains of moves.

I'm seventeen, education has took up seventy-five percent of my life,
and I hated every second of it. What, you expect me to lie?
I dropped out of college ‘cause I hated that negative vibe,
and it was teachers like you that made me feel aggressive inside.

You're not superior; we're the reason you get the pay that you do,
and if your pass rate is too low, the government are going to take it from you.
This is like Lunar C's SBTV, and you can't say it ain't true;
this is Blizzard vers’ shit teacher, but I get to say it to you.

My scriptures make Samuel Peeps look like any old man in the street,
make Martin Luther want to write another draft of his speech,
make the likes of Oscar Wilde and Confucius sit back and retreat.
Basically, I'm in a class even this man couldn't teach.

I'm pissed off at the haters; other rappers come off kinda sour.
I hate the school system and I'll never plead to a higher power.
You're just a tiny flower that I'll devour with a violent shower,
so fuck you, your campus, your lesson plan, and your £8.95 an hour.

MARK GRIST
I suggest that you fuck off, and play some Beyblade
before I slap you with an F grade,
or at least go jack off to some vampires like the rest of your age range.

He's trying to act tougher than me, but I suspect he might be nerdier.
You're about as intimidating as your city, and you're only slightly wordier.

I don't care about the aggressive shit you spit online or that everybody's heard of ya;
you'd still give yourself a hernia trying to assemble flat-pack furniture.

“But I keep dissing him for being a teacher, what have I gotta say so I can shock ya?”
The honest truth is, Bradley, I've been served better whilst in Costa.
I consider it a crime how much time you spend rhyming
about the rest of the Don't Flop opera;
it's a solo gun fight, not some homo-erotic spaghetti opera.

And in Bradley's last battle, he wasn't dreadful,
which means many doubt he even wrote it;
see this young Green plants himself with better rappers,
hopes to get it through osmosis.
The best of ventriloquist dummies; his ass can take on both fists,
then he rides them in so deep as he appears to be riding on their shoulders.

I don't have to write like Socrates to expose your mediocrity,
and considering the pics of the last battle I've seen,
I'm surprised you're not trying to get off with me.

Honestly, Bradley, besides getting date-raped by Australian women
and saying words a little bit quickly, I'm not quite sure what you actually do.
Plus, it's a sad fact that half your iPhone apps are actually older than you.
I'm not gonna deny that after his last battle his reputation grew,
but, if I'm being honest,
I'm gonna have to write, “has to improve” upon this term's review.

I have orchestrated this beautifully, like I was intricate on strings with it.
Co-Rone-ation day, from my Simba shit to the king of this.

Today I think like a king; it’s in my bones, in my speech.
Today I eat like a king; I’m thinking bon appetit.
It’s been six months. What glory did you bring home to the league?
You ain’t even seize the throne; that crown was thrown at your feet.

What is the title to you? Oh, what, now you’re a star?
No, you’re still broke. Bummy. Scrounging for rounds at the bar,
so I consider the term “title” not sounding so hard
when you’ll never have a title on a house or a car.

See, you never rap enough piff to pack up the joint,
and so they made a call to Rone(Calderon) to back up the point.

We could battle for one hour. We could do a one-rounder.
You lost the title after one match; that’s a short reign(rain) like a sun shower.

You think like such a pussy whenever you make a verse.
You’re so scared of what someone else might say, so you try to say it first.


Photo by Christian Andrabado for BattleRap.com.
Well I predict that you’ll predict what I do in this match.
And you’ll get done like the last prophet(Prophit) that I threw in the trash.
Boy thinks that he’s a psychic, but no one here’s believing him.
It’s funny he’s an extra small but he thinks that he’s a medium.

But this pussy smells fishy. Is that salmon or albacore?
Is he mackerel or just gutted? He can’t get a call back from Macklemore.
Bitch all my dogs loyal, like DJ Khaled or a labrador;
I’m in El Salvador, dodging bullshit off the cape just like a matador.
Bitch, I’m just getting started; this is salad course.
You’re mad trash like a bag full of apple cores.
Oh he ain’t catch it? Who the fuck he, Nelson Agholor?
If he the plug, I’ll rip him out by the power cord.

You think you could rap, but my flow’s so disgusting.
Stumpman, stumpman, stumpman, you like five foot nothing.
Since I brought my boys here I think I might jump him; no.
Since he this tall, damn, I think that I could jump him; whoa.

You live off apology checks you get ‘cause you’re a eighth Native American.
That means we’re paying you
to shut the fuck up and not complain ‘bout your heritage.

And that’s the only checks you get, the only income that you draw,
so if my people hadn’t killed your people, you would get no money at all.

I mean, no hood booger want to boogie with you.
No neighbor got any sugar to use.
I mean, Saurus gets ten million times more pussy than you,
and look at the dude.

And I bet those walls in the friend zone steep.
Twin bitches suck a nut for a Benzo each.
You a snitch and a broke little S.O.B.
I bet the pink slip on any car that Greg Poe lease.

Wait. Any bar that Ill conceived is ill-conceived.
It’s no illusion; Ill losing. This the guillotine.

It’s incredible; I’m what makes Ill edge-able,
the fact that he can’t read me. I feel like like I’m illegible,

but, you bragging ‘bout smoking weed in Oregon. I said that isn’t even Ill, is it?
Wait, smoking weed in Oregon; that isn’t even illicit.

Boy, I pass models coke on glass-bottom boats.
This some sacrificial slaughter. It’s the lamb vers’ the GOAT.
And I get he’s your bro and that you think that he’s dope,
but do me a favor: get Bigg K’s dick out your throat.

I mean, in the Caustic battle, you have his whole D in your mouthpiece.
You all over Kenny’s nuts like Stevie Janowski.
You taking trips, I make your bitch sit and leave me a house key,
then come piss on the rug like the scene from Lebowski.

World Dom One, we were faded off Canadian liquor.
Saurus had a bitch in his room; trying to say he could hit her,
but he declined, when he ain’t even have to pay for the stripper,
so for thinking Ill is straight(illustrate), well, what, I got to paint you a picture?

World Dom Two, you blackout wrestled Dirtbag Dan.
The full story is that Dirt merked that man.

At the hotel that night, he choked you out twice.
I’m used to your rounds putting me to sleep. Well now you know what that’s like.

Check, Illmac tried to rush him, right? Dan got him mummified.
He couldn’t have put you to sleep faster with warm milk and a lullaby.

So talk shit when I’m passing by you and it’s not a thing to pacify you,
and if you sleep on any of my shit tonight, then I’m looking for Dan behind you.

ILLMACULATE
He mentioned my homie from Seattle, which reminds me,
there’s just something wrong about you,
to the point Macklemore might make a song about you.

I mean, I’ll show you how to deliver the frees and get sick in the ring;
he said TheSaurus gets more pussy and he might be spitting the frees,
but that’s fitting. You know why that that’s fitting to me?
‘Cause you’re getting loose,
and this is the biggest pussy that’s every been given to me.

All right, look. Straight to it. I been the champ, before the title or trophy.
Get your wifey to blow me, but I don’t chase birds; that’s for Wile E. Coyote.
My fam is full of animals like I was Mowgli.
They won’t be happy ’til his head in a box: (Bing,) smiley emoji.
Get socked in the ring, like I’m Mick Foley minus the goatee.
You’d get ate(eight) with a twenty-four, but I’m retiring Roney
with a seasoned sixteen; shit remind me of Kobe.
I don’t play in the ring. Yo, you got no bars, like a parolee.
You got no bars, like a parolee.
I said it twice; that’s okay, ‘cause I guaranteed to pepper Roney.
Hold up. No bars, like a parolee. It doesn’t matter; you know why?
I’ll get a body out of nowhere like Kylie and Khloe.

Grimey. I’ll treat Roney like a entree served warm,
and never fight clean. I was always dirt poor.
I rep the North West like Kanye’s first-born.
You couldn’t ride the wave with Beyonce’s surfboard.
Surfboard.. Roney’s music? Nerdcore.

You are a joke. This motherfucker is a shtick.
Him and his friends get together and punch each other in the dick.

You are a clown. I guess college life made them closer;
they’re like, “party’s on, bro.” Invite some ladies over,
but don’t pass out. These guys could play the joker.
They shave each other’s eyebrows and draw dicks on their faces..
while they’re wide awake and sober.

You are a cornball. You’re battle rap for teeny boppers. Expose the gimmicks.
Wave riders: motion sickness.
I mean, we might be close in pigment, but the approach is different.
You, “white kid raps fast”, Mac Lethal, all viral. So suspicious.
I mean, why? Old traditions? Wholesome image?
It’s simple; you’re a symbol of their own existence. Clothes and skin, shit,
they look at you, see a mirror. Don’t even know the difference.
Just can’t get Past his Presence. Oh. So simplistic.
They think he’s the Future ‘cause he reflects their lives like the Ghosts of Christmas.

You’re battle rap for dummies, for the casual fan.
Get rocked; whip him with my spatula hand since he a flash in the pan.
That’s just the tip of the iceberg; the Titanic get slammed.
Put us in the same boat, I’ll split you like a catamaran.
If my name’s at stake(steak), I got cattle to brand.
Bitch, I’m a legend, and I still(steel) open doors, like a battering ram.

You a virus; I’ll penicillin ya.
There’s never been a ceiling to my writing so my pen is sealing ya.
Spiteful. I bet it’s killing ya. Thirsty. Riding on genitalia.
Such a desperate for attention whore, where he’s from is a metaphor.
Be mindful, his city’s telling ya.
He’d probably swap AIDS with Tom Hanks just to go viral in Philadelphia.

See, you’re just here to entertain, so you’re feeling like the cash crop,
but that little bit of fame dries up when the laughs stop,
so you can have them views, ‘cause I’ll be here when your fans not.
I’ll hold down the champ slot. He can be the mascot.

Round Two
RONE
You said I could be the mascot, but no one believes you.
If it wasn’t for the stage, no one could see you.

But, I’ve battled fat rappers. I’ve battled short rappers.
I’ve battled gun rappers, but never sword rappers.

He doesn’t rap about guns ‘cause they’re not realistic.
He’ll rap about dragons that fight with Aladdin, but it comes to ‘matics
and he’ll be like eh-eh.
He’ll rap about Frodo and all-seeing logo, but it comes to fo’-fo’s
and he’ll be like no, no.

Well what you got, the Yoroitoshi or the bolo on ya?
You got the viking, or the bowie, or the old katana?

I’m in the cuts just laughing at the blade at your side.
Rocking stilettos, you’ve been giving off a rapier vibe,

like it’s a game in your mind, trying to perpetuate that thug life.
He holds his blade like a mic, screaming, “All I need is one knife.”

That shit isn’t cut right. That shit shows your blood type.
There’s a name for that: bringing a knife to a gun fight.

I mean, you rap of the corniest shit:
“I’ll take the hammer of Thor off Orion’s belt.
If I stared at Medusa, her eyes would melt.”
Shut the fuck up.

That shit’s your only angle, so you don’t want to tangle.
If the Illuminati are what’s keeping your music off the radio,
we owe them a “thank you”.

See I could coach him, like Cus D’Amato, with details like custom autos.
You think that it’s just bravado? I done this(Dundas) like West Toronto.
You playing yourself on stage just like he John Leguizamo.
So fuck Hitori Hanzo; I’ll turn Greg into Greg Giraldo.

Bro, you look like Wee Man with a cheap tan and no bread.
If you’re ever kicking yourself, it’s probably in your own head.
His name is Greg Poe but it should be Po’ Greg
‘cause I’d be your size if I had no legs.

A paper cut could lay him up under a surgical lampshade.
Then we could cover your whole body with one vertical band-aid.
I will give your fam shells like I’m serving a clam bake,
then I’ll break down a pound like I’m learning a handshake.

What you know about talking about fake drug shit to fit in?
You can’t argue with that.
Fucking selling edibles out in Oregon, well you started with snacks.
On that white in New York, you want to party with Smack;
whenever sonny(Sunny) In Philadelphia then it’s(Dennis) Charlie with Mac.

But who getting Jobs in the Apple out of Mac and Tosh(MacIntosh)?
And if you can’t get booked there, you can’t get looked at one of the battle gods.

He break the law in front of some cops out in Brooklyn for sport,
just so he could say that he got booked in New York.

Fuck if you pray to the West; you look like prey to the East,
and so it’s asalamalakum, then I’m making him sleep.
I feel like Kanye if it came to the beef,
‘cause I’d throw 500 on a fade every day of the week.

Oh, you got locked up? Well it doesn’t count if you were trying to get caught,
buying drugs, shining your watch in the eyes of the cops.

Like, “Please, at least slam me down or pull me out of traffic, pal,
or at least get me patted down, so I have something to rap about.”

You the dude at the DUI checkpoint like, “I know my rights.”
As he’s riding home at night down the road on a stolen bike.

Talking ‘bout, diamonds are evil and jewelry is opulent,
’til you got your first chain and you couldn’t stop rocking it.

You think you got it figured out about anything ornate.
You think expensive clothes exemplify poor taste.
You trying to justify the salad that’s sitting on your plate,
acting like meat is murder ‘cause you can’t afford steak.

What look, outside of battling, did Illmaculate get?
You turn your opportunities into nothing, and that’s sad as a bitch,
and now you couldn’t even leave if we asked you to quit.
It’s like you’re holding onto battling like it’s the only thing you have, ‘cause it is.

ILLMACULATE
This body’s about be a classic in this bitch.
He brought up the Hitori Hanzo blade, like that shit was a myth.
..I think Rone thinks that he’s actually a prince.

I’m confused, Rone, ‘cause you talk like man, but you act like bitch.
I mean, you look like Rone, but you rap like Twist.
I drank with Norm Kelly. We toast a glass like this;
said “Cheers”, and told Norm I got his back like Cliff.

You called him a bitch, sounding a bit jelly.
But who’s the mayor of Philly? Go ‘head, bitch, tell me.
No? No? Cool, ‘cause Norm ‘ll beat the shit out of Jim Kenny
and run him out of Philly quicker than Chip Kelly.


Photo by Zach Macphoto.
You battled DNA. Day of the event, here’s an angle he ‘a pick:
he said black rappers don’t raise their kids. You a racist piece of shit.
If that’s who you want as champ, you can get AIDS and eat a dick,
‘cause that shit ain’t acceptable on any stage or league you with.
For real, that’s the reason some fans don’t care KOTD exists.
First you gay this week, then switch.
You’re cornier than the day Charron claimed that he’s a crip.
You should be put in your place and make good on your statements,
but he ran track at Penn State, so he’s always been good with the races.

I heard he was getting roasted on the messageboard
after blogging throwing a tantrum on the tennis court,
which I thought was the perfect metaphor:
you know, him getting served over the net when he could’ve been a better sport?

It’s perfect, ‘cause in that blog,
he said I was the benefactor of the system, that’s why I get more credit,
while blogging from all-white facility for indoor tennis.
(You don’t see the— all right.)

Benefactor of what, Rone? It’s been a long road, chockfull of potholes.
I lost a match in the ring, I was Jack with the beans;
I aimed high ’til my stock(stalk) rose.
Stockholm. Yeah, the fans can be hot-cold,
but mono e mono I’ll cook you like pot roast on a hot stove,
or waffles at Roscoe’s. You a snot-nose;
but I wrote is (sniff) El Chapo to nostrils.
So don’t reach; that’s a Dot role.
Don’t Flop; you a lost Soul.
Dude is silly; you from Philly? I’m Ali when he boxed Joe.
Get it? You boxed, Rone. You’re John Doe; you’re spot’s blown like a foxhole.
You’re not dope; you’re not Diz; he’s not me; he’s not grown.
And we all know that I’m 5’4”,
but if I roll to Rone’s crib then Rone’s getting 5-0’ed;
in three rounds you’re getting five-o’ed. You rap fast; you could die slow.
Toronto, this is not close.
He’s Tosh hosting a talk show; I mean he’s got jokes,
but what I’ve written will inspire ambition in a writer(Rida),
a combo of Pac’s ghost, Hollow and Pablo Picasso in God mode.

Bruh, even you admit you’re corny. It’s just sad that your fans can’t.
Spoiled brat. His parents paid for rap camp and half the sales on Bandcamp.
He just wants what he can’t have, so he wrote until his hands cramped,
then got the chain as a lower back tat. Know what he calls it? His champ stamp.

But he’s soon to be the king. Soon to be the k— that’s how they brand you,
cool. I got the King, helpless. Think, Elvis.
Watch where this fall from grace lands(Graceland) you.

Malpractice: boy, I’m out of patience(patients) and such.
Soon to be the— man, that obnoxious phrase is a crutch.
Got ‘em calling you “king” for no reason: conversations with Lux.
(Look at me, kid. Oh, he gon get this work.)

See, his whole persona is “look at me, look at me,” so proud of his fame.
They should call you team mascot when announcing your name.
You know why? He puts on this character to keep the crowd entertained,
then pulls a couple stunts,
’til a real player comes and you get taken out of the game.

Round Three
RONE
What’s the point of going out on a tour
when there’s no one in the crowd when you clowns go perform?
You’re so deep in the game, still sleeping down on the floor.
You act proud, but it rots you right down to your core,
so, to say I fuck with you? Well I doubt it for sure;
renowned or obscure, I never heard a sound you recorded,
bitch, you’ve been making music since 2004
and I still haven’t listened to one album of yours.

And the fans of your rap music are white as a Klan unit.
I’m trying to make him embrace it, but damn it, he can’t do it.
He should be grassroot-ing, but instead he pack-mule-ing,
‘lac cruising, gat shooting, back of the tan Buick,
said you had nicks(Knicks) for starters, like Al Houston and Pat Ewing.
What’s next, you making gram movements like Fat Jewish?
Well, that lightweight angle is shaky as Shaq shooting,
and that’s stupid as Atlanta fans rooting for Cam Newton.

Boy, you said your dream battle’s Jin. I couldn’t give a shit less.
It’s funny a little Asian kid couldn’t make you a success(6s).

It’s a vignette on forgotten skill and a prequel to popping pills;
it’s sick how you think you’re sick. How the mighty have fallen(,) Ill.

Bro. Pat Stay’s first was all short jokes to put this herb down,
so for me to try any of that shit would be retarded.
But I gave Pat Stay every short joke he used in his first round,
so I was up one nothing before this battle even started.

I don’t have short jokes; I don’t have short facts.
I don’t have short quotes; I just have short math.

Lookism. A guy who’s 5’6” has to make $183,000 a year
more than someone who is 6’ to be deemed equally attractive.
That’s $24,000 an inch. That’s the fraction we’ll use,
and what I did is I took my height and subtract it from dude’s.
So look at you, 5’5”, but that’s adding a few;
so Google me. 6’1 and a half or 6’2”.
Before this battle even starts, by all the math that I do,
I’m already a quarter million dollars more attractive than you.

And there’s nothing you can do about it. You know that it’s unfair.
You could be Brad Pitt in the face and no woman would care.

I mean, there’s height restrictions in the military. I don’t know why; it’s disgusting,
but of course you hate the government. You’re too short to die for your country.

So that explains his head condition,
his conspiracies, his pessimism.
Another adolescent victim, short, poor, expecting visits
from a daddy who’d never swing it, so rage done festered in him
and he turned it against the system,
but being short is no excuse for being a mental midget.

I mean, you hate yourself for being short. I can tell it through your face.
But look on the bright side; there’s less of you hate.

And losses are a positive, so you should see some growth from this,
but the fact is, you’re 5’3” and you just can’t get over it.

He’s jealous I call myself the Prince, like that should describe you.
Well, maybe you’re right, too, ‘cause you and Prince are both 5’2”.

I call myself the Prince as a Symbol, that I’m forging my own path.
I call myself the Prince ‘cause it will always be something I was formerly known as.

Like: 2056, in a nursing home. T-Rex’s granddaughter is nursing holmes.
Brittle bones, decrepit clothes, shoes too big for your feet,
‘cause after all the years of gravity, he’s shrunken to 4’3”.

He’s past the whole rapping thing. Now he’s battling for his sanity.
Dementia and Alzheimer’s; he can’t recognize his own family,

so they don’t visit. He’s so lonely; his incontinent useless ass.
Well one of the nurses, somehow, hears that he used to rap,

so as a birthday present, she decides to drag a classic out.
Gets all the invalids, the old people, and has them gather ‘round.
She says it’s Illmac versus Rone, but then he panics at the sound,
‘cause as soon as he hears my name, then he flashes back to now,

and suddenly, he’s wishing for his casket and his death.
Suddenly, he’s short of air and he’s grabbing for his neck,
and if that was then and this is now, and you’re still panicking through sweat,
then imagine just how bad it was at the actual event.

ILLMACULATE
He keeps bringing up conspiracies, and half of you laugh.
Well, I must be a conspiracy theorist; that’s actually facts.
Shit, I feel like B.O.B. with what Adam just rapped,
‘cause I swear that entire round was actually flat.

As a matter fact, you talking ‘bout my drugs, when I got caught for the case.
He didn’t mention my P’s, did he(Diddy)?
I mean that’d be perfect, ‘cause his most-reacted line is when he remixed me.
(P Diddy - Remix me? Fuck all that.)

What you looking at? You are not a man. You will never be a man.
You know why? He let Pat palm the back of his head with his hand.

Never mind Sandusky molesting this bitch.
YouTube “getting brains in the lac”. I didn’t edit this shit.
It’s a video of you giving Pat head in the whip.
You don’t remember the clip? You didn’t think I would mention this shit?
Pat looked like MadChild last Blackout:
a Swollen Member getting neck while he’s stiff.

The video starts, Pat getting head in the car. Nothing too embarrassing in it,
’til it’s revealed it’s not a girl, it’s you. Genius. Being gay is hilarious. Get it?
(No? Me either.)

Tell me this: what was the moment you became aware they were taping there?
Was it when Pat came, you came up for air, wiped your facial hair
after treating Pat’s dick like you was ‘bout to find the chain in there?

I guess we just from two different scenes,
‘cause I ain’t trying to get on YouTube and Watch(-)men do shit obscene.
You normally play the Comedian, but in that new clip I seen,
you just went Dr. Manhattan on us: just blew(blue) dick on screen.

Hey, fuck it though. You should get a letterman jacket for pleasuring Pat.
Giving head in the ‘lac. Yo, I guess when he lettered in track
ain’t the only time he’s ever been a(-)head in a lap.

We both battled Pat. Look how we related to him.
I left with Pat’s head. You gave it to him.

How did that relationship start? Does he think that it’s fate as well?
Or did you just slide in his DMs like, “A/S/L”?
That shit’s gay as hell, and you taped it. Well,
I don’t care he made it, he’s Larry David: he played himself.

You know what? You’re the most disrespected battler. Pesci ain’t got shit on you.
Daylyt left the stage and dipped on you. Pat Stay put his dick on you.
Diz made you dress up as Bruce Jenner and put a wig on you.
Now, I’m ‘bout to wig on you.
The judge decide the outcome, think Pimp a Butterfly album:
I got schitz(skits) on you.
Slap that Roney Baby the Prince off you;
cold case. Charron’s face: leave prints on you.
Break you down; put it together: I’ll jigsaw you.
Show up to your improv group, impromptu, insult the chick on you,
diss her, and spit on you. No, Diz / Eurgh spit on you.
I’ll diss her(Eurgh) and leave: Irvine crip on you.
Walk in your crib on you, skip the welcome mat, wipe my kicks on you.
Slap the cereal bowl out your hand and go Queenzflip in the whip on you
when I whip on you.

You know what? It’s something bothering me, I just can’t ignore it.
Everybody blames Sandusky; they got the facts distorted.
I mean, if you seen what Rone was wearing, he was practically asking for it.

Forget the rape. That’s a subject that we’ll avoid.
I mean, I had to mention it; I didn’t have any choice,
but now it’s a tactic employed he’s learned to handle with poise,
so fuck it, I’ll bell-clap him. Won’t hear any actual noise.
Flat on canvas, no punch landed; you scrapping with Floyd.
Shoulder lock, crack clavicle; grapple on point.
Jab like Zab; jaw tap him like Roy.
Body blow, head shot; his jaw crack like his voice.
Mandible snapped at the joint.
Hey yo Sandusky! That’s how you put hands on this boy.

And as you just seen, I beat his ass so badly,
I’m on my next lap. Next title match, me and Pass in Cali.
(Whassup?)

Top ten battle rappers of 2015, and the “Bar God” didn’t even make the list.
Every time you say “Bar God”, I want to walk in your kid’s birthday party, take a piss
on the cake and ice cream, stick a candle in it, and tell him make a wish.
They like, “why you disrespecting the Bar God?”
‘Cause what the fuck is a Bar God to a atheist?

Danny, I don’t believe in you.
Spit one bar about my ex-girls, and I’ma show what this heater do.
I’m trying to see if this bullet could tore(Couture)
through the right side of your body before it’s leaving you.
Rap about Ash, then you’ve.. gotta catch ‘em all; a bullet’s seeking you.
What I did to the body’s shocking; the kids don’t even want to peek at you(Pikachu).

This nigga look like two ninja turtles put together.
Fuck is you, Rapha-angelo or Dona-nardo?
You not a god, bro.
You never made Lux lean on the ropes, go toe-to-toe or had to box with Hollow.
You rap with speed, but that don’t make you a Creed. Nigga, you not Apollo.
You sloppy when you rush in(Russian) with the punches: that make you Ivan Drago.
When shit get Rocky, Clips get cocky. I got this big bravado.
Cannon under the Big T; let’s switch the scene, now we in Chicago.
Giving him 300 off one leg: that’s two Dirks. Did you niggas follow?
See they ain’t get it. I black out here and there; I got vitiligo.

Hold up. Y’all know what? I’m so motherfucking mean with it,
let’s bring that skin shit back and do a whole ‘nother scheme with it.

Danny, New York is mine. A nigga throw an event, then I want in.
Tonight if they make eleven racks, then I want ten,
but they paid me to make y’all go through bars. Well I’ma turn y’all into a wino then.
Even when I go light, I’m blacking out. That’s albino skin.

I’m in every league going loco. I don’t just do it for the Smack bread.
When I was younger, I had two twin ratchets on me.
That’s when I first learned how to clap lead.
With them two twin ratchets, I was short. So I was only hitting back leg.
Mary Kate and Ashley: when I got older, I seen them twin ratchets crack head.

Hold up. Y’all know what? I’m so motherfucking mean with it,
since y’all ain’t get the whole crackhead shit,
I’ll bring it back and do a whole ‘nother scheme with it.

Danny, if your House is Full of white, sit calm(sitcom),
‘cause I’m about to take this gun and put it to the bald scalp.
With a knife, I’ll get to cutting like a DJ, or give him a shell inside the boy mouth.
Mary Kate and Ashley: with them drugs, them twin ratchets is getting pulled out.
How ironic, for Danny’s tan, or(Tanner).. I’ll be running inside that Full House.

I told y’all I ain’t come to play with the “Bar God”. I’ma catch him with a mean gun.
Put a hole in his head, but not just any hole, the Rasheed one.
Tell my niggas to light it up, and then smoke him before the weed done.
I was trying to think of a slogan,
but when you kill a nigga this bad, you don’t need one.

DANNY MYERS
Let’s get straight into these rhymes, homie.
I’m ‘bout to… I was just waiting on NuNu to call time on me.

This is Clips versus a nigga with clips. They know the fifth ‘ll blam.
His brain will spread for a couple of meters. That’s an attention span.

Listen, man. Play it cool, or else your man is buried.
He thought he was the g.o.a.t., ’til he ran into a man who was born in January.
I’ll cap a corn(capricorn).

This nigga don’t want to bang with Myers.
I’ll nail you in the street, leave you flat, then change attire(a tire).

Remember our phone battle, when I first killed you? Well now the gun is calling.
I’m Matrix through the phone: any second now, you should see the numbers falling.

Beef can last from day to night. Pay attention when you fucking with me, Clips.
A round ‘ll cover your son if my pockets on E, Clips(eclipse).

You peep this? Round, cover the sun, day to night I’m frying challengers.
I’ll catch your crew and mill any ‘em(millennium). That’s the Mayan calendar.

This the highest caliber. Bitch nigga, your whole set brittle.
My dick wrap around your girl throat like a neck pillow.

That tech peeling. One headshot ‘ll floor this nigga.
The kick won’t show mercy for Chuck Norris, nigga.

First, I’ll put the strap in your face, then lace his shit.
Then blow a hole through your bitch; she needed space in the relationship.

Face it, Clips. I don’t care if your damn marriage good.
I’m planning to pop one in her; that’s planned parenthood.

In beef, we ain’t always got to pull a gun.
We mail fingers to mothers; that’s a rule of thumb.

This fool is dumb. I’m a god, but you still got a brave heart.
But if we are(R) in a circle, it should Register we got to trade(,)mark.

I’m trying to save art. You cheat the fans. I let the thang spark.
It can’t be two g.o.a.t.s, and both of our careers not on the same arc.

I have flashbacks of shootouts, bullets dividing flesh.
Now I draw, off recollection; that’s a composite sketch.

You can put your fists up, but I’m holding some shit that’ll change the landscape.
What I grip ‘ll cover his knuckle like the Mason handshake.

I have a need to kill bitch ass niggas. It’s like a primal pressure.
My need ‘ll(needle) get shit sended; it’s like a final record.

Charlie, I checked backgrounds on your crew; ain’t no felons.
What’s your daddy really locked up for? Ain’t no telling.

But I could tell you this: you spit gun bars like you’re the baddest walking,
when all you’ll really do is Fire In the Sky like Travis Walton.

You’ll leave this planet. You can clown ’til someone abducts you.
You a foe(UFO), but you won’t get the picture ’til a round hovers above you.

We take the drama quite serious.
We drive through his hood ’til we spot his pad, like a light period.

It ain’t sweet. I got a bunch of homies from grape street.
If I sock you and don’t knock you out, you better fake sleep.

We eight deep. We’ll bring that eighty to your camp.
I’ll watch my dogs split your noodle like Lady and the Tramp.

Don’t be a diva, mister. Otherwise the whole team ‘ll split ya.
We’ll have it popping on the side your mouth like a fever blister.

I ether niggas, and he on the ground with this shit;
this wack emcee got another two rounds of this shit. Yikes.

Round Two
CHARLIE CLIPS
Let’s get straight to the jokes.
Don’t front for these people like you some type of nice dude.
You gon cut me up a million times, weigh me on a conveyor belt,
say a joke - I look like Ah Di Boom mixed with Ice Cube.

Well, I’m from Harlem and I love to snap,
so if that’s the game you want to play, then I’ll play along,
and I’m so real with this shit, I won’t even change from Ice Cube.
In fact, I’ma perform one of my favorite songs.

Straight outta twelve racks, a stupid motherfucker named Danny,
gave his whole life savings up to Randy,
came home with no dinner for his family,
eight dollars left and he spent it on brandy.

Nigga, you pussy. Danny, you soft; that’s what my hood say.
Let a nigga take twelve racks from me, my whole hood spray.
This nigga gon be dead; Ice Cube won’t be able to perform “It Was a Good Day”.

My Boyz n the Hood ‘ll ride up, tell you, “hop in.”
Take the silencer, put the nozzle on,
he jump out the car. Funny ass nigga,
knew he ain’t have the heart(Hart) to Ride Along.

Them Ice Cube jokes won’t work, ‘cause you remind me of Eazy E.
Not ‘cause you fucking bitches raw, or what you do to females is trifling;
you remind me of Eazy E for a different reason.
Oh, pay attention, ‘cause the details is frightening.
See, Rex lied about getting locked up, and you knew it.
And I got a question: why D ain’t strike him?
He took your money and left you sick, blood,
you should’ve been in T cell fighting.

That last scheme was sick, by the way, but listen,
we can find a cure with all the money that Rex holding,
and since you got your money tooken from that nigga,
how ‘bout I hit him with Rex slogan?

I’ma pop Danny in the neck, and walk of with this nigga head.
Y’all know Rex slogan, right? (Crowd: This nigga dead.)

Yeah, this nigga dead once this nigga said,
“If I don’t get my money I’ma kill—“ and Rex still got this nigga bread.
He threw his hands up. I’m like, who still(steal) boxes? This nigga Craig.
Fuck a Friday, I get D bowed(Debo) and leave this nigga Red.

Why would y’all put the fastest internet connection up
against a nigga that’s just dial-up?
No lie, ’02 draft: I got a Rocket that could pick Yao up.
I started out with the Hawks, but my gun connect told me to switch my style up.
’01 draft: I got on my grizzly and picked the pow(Pau) up.

For my basketball niggas,
if you know the ’01 and ’02 draft, y’all gon say, “man, that shit crack.”
For the Danny Myers fans.. “Oh he spit his battle rap bars and basketball,”
y’all gon say that shit wack.
I’ll respect you if you get your twelve from Rex.
Well, you did battle him, so you might not get that,
but at least be a man, Danny. Ask K-Shine to get you six back.
(Oh, you not Dot Mob no more?)

DANNY MYERS
You brought up that Rex $12k shit. What, y’all niggas trying to rob me?
Well tell your niggas come find me.
Bitch, I keep paper around me like the nigga behind me.

When we in the barber shop, you never get mentioned. Nigga, fuck favors.
You not a rider. We don’t Converse about anything that Chuck tailors(Taylors).

You better duck blazers. You’ll see the beam. We wild niggas.
When these arms crossed, you’ll get a boom. I beguile(Guile) niggas.

Oh, you and your niggas slipping? Cool. I’m holding them up.
You’ll say hi to this bitch like when Odom woke up.

Oh, guess which room you in? Ain’t no nigga cold as I.
I’ll start off shooting in the bathroom like GoldenEye.

Don’t stall on me. I’ll leave you in the dirt stinking.
You’ll be Stomped ’til your soul is God’s Property like Kirk Franklin.

I’m sir painting. I don’t talk this shit to generate likes.
Run in his house with the Mac-11 and renovate twice.
I’ll leave a painting on your wall of me shooting you in the head
just to show you how art imitates life.

I screw the silencer on the front of the barrel before the gat is burned.
All you’re hear is (psh, psh), like getting at a nigga bitch when his back is turned.

When will these rappers learn? Doubt that I’m heat and I’ma crucify him.
Then I remain silent, ‘cause everything you say, they trying to scrutinize it.

But who am I to say who’s top tier or how to do it proper?
I ain’t Mook or Hoffa, or dudes that’s got to got on stage in a suit and tie, but,
when you get this work, and ain’t satisfied with it, you get the supervisor.
Now we could go on and scrap, but my nigga would sneak behind you.

You get a hook that you ain’t even know was there, like a bonus track;
what’s wrong with cats?

You escaped death from Lux, barely.
You must be on rock, and roll if you want to be the one that Chuck bury(Berry).

What’s up, scary? Ain’t no way your team cook mine.
All my niggas rolling strapped like Bokeem Woodbine.

The young homies trying to earn their stripes; they know their role’s minor.
That’s why they’ll light on the top of your head like a coal miner.

Go ahead and act like you Apollo. You’ll feel the impact of a land mine.
Walk up on me while I’m holding the sawed-off, you out your damn mind.
Kneel(Niel). This arm’s strong(Armstrong).
You’ll be sent to the moon when I blam mine,
so take one small step, and you’ll take a giant leap for mankind.
(Just trying to put space between us.)

They want to know the physics of how I did it.
Lift the trey pound; calisthenics, blow you to the outer limits of our existence.
You’ll never catch me slipping; I even take a shower with it.
It ain’t gon make a minor difference;
I’ll spray the can and air out the room like it’s flower-scented.
Your hourglass ain’t got a hour in it.

Nigga, it’s nothing like me.
This is a nigga talking ‘bout “syke”, versus a nigga in his psyche.

Nike jacket cover my waist to hide the heater;
I’m getting paid to break down Clips like Roger Ebert.

If I text my nigga and tell him to shoot you, he putting one in your head, G.
Soon as he grab his phone and scroll, you’ll be dead, see?

If you thought I was gon bring up Couture or old angles, man, you missing the script.
This a empty gun: I don’t need ammunition for Clips.
I’m from where you stood in front of the man you get and you spit.
And this wack emcee got a whole ‘nother round of this shit. Yikes.

Round Three
CHARLIE CLIPS
The plan was to kill Danny in December. But this nigga got a hundred kids,
so I figured ah, fuck it, let him enjoy his Christmas first,
‘cause December twenty-fifth is when you get the gift, but,
January tenth is when you get the curse.
Head shot; get a nurse.
Captain Planet: that mean clean him up. Lift his Earth.
All them bars niggas had about my pops;
well let’s talk about how you was trying to snitch on Surf.

You was on Angryfan yelling more than a angry fan.
You was showing niggas that you could scream well.
“Ah Di Boom wrote Surf bars, Ah Di Boom wrote Surf bars,”
you was on the phone sounding like a diesel female.
You know Ah Di Boom is doing time,
so he wouldn’t be able to call him and get the details,
but ironically, we ain’t have to give a Boom a ring(boomerang)
‘cause the shit came back around in the form of a email.

Ah Di wrote, and I quote, “I did not write for Surf.”
So you took a nigga fake situation, even tried to lie about it and hype it too.
“I got screenshots of Surf text messaging Ah Di.”
I wouldn’t be surprised if you was the one that typed them, too.
You not a Bar God, you a bar fraud; stealing some of my work is what you like to do.
Now I feel like Ah Di, ‘cause behind these bars, I got a right to sue(write to Tsu).

But I don’t like to sue, bitch nigga. Fuck court.
The streets is where I’m holding my trial.
I walk in while you playing with your son.
“Oh, you gon shoot the Bar God while he holding his child?”
Nah, I’ll walk off, hit him with that syke-I-lied, then start unloading the pound;
I don’t give a fuck. Your whole family is getting treys(trays): we at Golden Corral.

Hold up. You know what? I’m so motherfucking mean with it,
a fat nigga rapping about a restaurant? I got to do a whole ‘nother scheme with it.

I was on the phone with my nigga Buddens; he said, “eat him.”
I said, “Why, Joe?” He said, “‘cause that sucka food.”
I said, “the head shot gon be Sloppy, Joe, but man, which(Manwich) gun to use?”

What you got is salad bars.
You’ll probably let us(lettuce) put the banana clip on your Adam’s apple.
Man, if he don’t chill, he’s(Chili’s) getting hit with the gun
’til I crack a(Cracker) Barrel.

Niggas complaining about that recycling shit against Big Kannon.
Look what happened to Suge. I been on my grind since.
Sometimes when you freestyle you bug out.
Truth be told, I don’t know where my mind went.
What you with, four niggas on stage? Well, I’ma recycle again.
I keep that nine gripped,
act like I’m walking off, bring the can back and get five sent(cents).

Y’all saw State Property, right?
Hey Swave, in Harlem, we gon throw Danny a mean party.
Bunch of choppers in the shit like a mean homi, machines prob’ly.
But I don’t need a gun;
I’ll walk in swinging on everybody, like, “it wasn’t me, Charlie,”
I don’t give a fuck. Even the wrong niggas getting crowned; I feel like Steve Harvey.

I told this nigga, I’ma run on Danny with a mean gun;
put a whole in his head, but not just any hole. The Rasheed one.
Tell my niggas to light it up and then smoke him before the weed done.
I was trying to think of a slogan,
but when you kill a nigga this bad, you don’t need one.

DANNY MYERS
…club just to bring the star.
I set it up, so I could tell you in your face, I’m the king of Harlem.

But my stories deeper; you’ll be left with gory features
when these kicks fly, and I ain’t talking ‘bout Mauri sneakers.
My Mexican plug said he could sell me forty cheaper,
so I got that Alien transporting with the white bitch like Sigourney Weaver.

You don’t got to understand the intricacies of my flowing and scheming
or notice the meaning, just know it’s demeaning.
I’m controlling a demon. I’m holding the secret.

You’re like D, how did I come up with this?
Long nose leading to a ruptured disk: snuffaluffagus’ trunk is sick.
Spare a nigga for real: stuff him up the trunk to fit.
His subsequent thoughts, tied up, is, “what the fuck is this?”

But this ain’t even about you. Even though I had to do this in person,
it was the disservice of your Diz verses that deserves this.
Bar God. I’m from a world where my pen’s perfect,
but in the underworld, it appears plain when I invert it.

I no longer have to punch these niggas.
A baldheaded man premeditating murder when I’m amongst(monk) these niggas.

Y’all can boo this(Buddhist), but it won’t cause my mind to worry.
Y’all must be off Buddha
if you can’t see between my temples lies a mind that’s scary(monastery).
Just you even being here in honorary.
My lines are worth money; you could put my bars on Ah Di Boom’s commissary.

I gave my young homie a pound of weed to get his first cake up.
That means I had the green on the corner with my pupil, like when you first wake up.

No joke, I should’ve walked in this bitch wearing a cloak.
The form of a droid was my apparent approach.

If there is a g.o.a.t., it’s always Lux, Hollow, Mook, and Clips,
but they fail to mention the West like we ain’t got shit to do with this.
This bias has to stop. Even the South got a few that spit.
Ha, I’m Official with double M, you stupid little bitch.

The hood loves Myers, ‘cause they can feel when he’s spitting.
I’m popping you point blank; you ain’t getting killed from a distance.
I’ll shoot you on this rainy day;
your coat fall in a puddle in front of your girl. You dead, but chivalry isn’t.

Fore real, I can feel the resistance. I’m spitting ’til he sleep in coffins.
This is Jesus talking with the mindframes of Stephen Hawking
when he was walking. Proceed with caution.

Ask his family, they know.
Who winning this battle? You can tell by they fucked up faces. Danny trey-oh(Trejo).

But the comments gon say “Clips 3-0”. They try to cheat Danny.
Let me introduce to the man that can beat Danny. Meet Danny.
For bitch niggas like you is why I keep the heat handy.
Get a Clue how I’m Fabolous with the king like the Street Family.

I’ma shoot your bulldog looking ass at all costs, and throw the weapon.
But don’t worry, Charlie. All dogs go to the heaven.

I’m a flowing legend, and you on the ground with this shit.
Thank the lord he ain’t got another round of this shit. Yikes.

Aye Verb vers’ Charlie Clips:

he said, “If a nigga wanna see that Holla and Verb,
put that money up, and I will not serve.”
So what the fuck are we battling for, Verb?
Those few bars alone already prove you not a man to your word.

You created who, me? Nigga, I perfected my grind,
‘cause Word War was yours, but it was technically mines.

I had the most wins, won the most money, battles stayed packed,
did the most views, I’m just naming facts,

but the long story short, for the people that wanna know,
it was Aye Verb’s stage. Your boy just took over the show.

This ain’t for the king of the city, I did this for whatever cash,
‘cause I can’t take a crown from him that he never had.
We could take to streets or keep it rap. It’s whatever Chaz,
but make the wrong choice, you gon leave here in a leather bag.

Aye Pops, niggas calling my phone, I’m like, “y'all don’t know nathin’.”
Handle what situation, Aye Verb? I got a degree in communications.

Hip thing off the dresser, I wish you would test us,
boy, I’ll expose Verb like a English professor.

You probably got a step on me in lyrics. That’s what you do the most,
but delivery and quotes? Ain’t even close.
Performance? I got you beat by a hundred bolts.
They laugh at you, not with you, you motherfucking joke.

Now I could’ve got personal, but I chose not.
And it’s BMG gang; we something you hoes not.
Close curtain how you get certainly closed in a box;
better do some soul searching or get your soul shot.
You will never run the streets, nigga, I’m a roadblock.

A couple niggas wanna call your bluff. I should auction you,
but I told niggas he cool. That’s what bosses do.
But watch what you say in your rhymes. Be cautious, dude,
‘cause I’ll forget it’s rap and stop your verse like, “who you talking to?”

It ain’t a street bone in his body, he’s not what he seem.
I punch niggas with no warning; been snapping since a teen.
And you look kind of confused; let me show you what that mean.
My set no playground, so I ain’t gotta get pushed for me to swing.

It’s a lot of weapons I could slay y'all with.
The black gloves, rubber grip with the radar chip.
I’ll come to one of Verb parties with a A.R. clip,
and shoot soon as I get in like I’m J.R. Smith.
Fuck it, I'ma remix it:
It’s a lot of weapons I could slay y'all with.
The black gloves, rubber grip with the radar chip. (x2)
I’ll come to one of Verb parties with a A.R. clip,
and shoot soon-and shoot soon-and shoot soon-and shoot soon-
and shoot soon as I get in like I’m J.R. Smith.

Matter fact you a bitch, man up, you need to bark when you bite.
You was a sucka back then; you a sucka tonight.
At any time you feel tempted, it’s nothing to fight.
I cut his ring off; my footwork tougher than Mike’s.
By the time that you agree, you get snuffed with a right.
You marketable; I’m remarkable. We’re nothing alike.
And you act the way you act because your mother’s a dyke.
(Throw some racks up?) when I rap; it’s fucking advice.

I ain’t an STL rookie my nigga; they threw the best on him.
Looking around, where the niggas that put the vets on him?
Let the caps fly on stage, go Rex on him.
Cash on his head, got money orders and checks on him.
Nigga you a bitch, no reason to pull a Tec on him;
I’ll put him way in the hole, I’ll in-debt homie.

You old ass clown, just an old ass noun,
let a young nigga shine. Sit your old ass down.

I know I said I could’ve got personal, but I chose not.
I was talking first round; second round, it gets hot.
Ballgame.

AYE VERB
A nigga hit me up and told me, “Verb, Holla on YouTube dissing you.”
My first thoughts, “Holla? Nada, my nigga, go get a clearer view.”

He said “It’s Holla, I’m watching. Go watch it.” Instantly I got hot,
like, “This emotional, seven-day menstrual move weak pencil move
having, disloyal, bitch-made, fool-ass punk, this snake (inaudible)”

Clicked the link to the interview, to see what he trying to get into,
and this nigga says, “I’m mad at Verb 'cause he ain’t come to my Arsonal battle;
he ain’t call me in seven months.” Some shit a bitch’d do.
It’s pitiful how a million views could change Holla to a different dude,
but to me, he still that same bird-ass nigga
who never got bread, not even pigeon food.
He down, he call me for the loan. He who I give it to.
When his baby mama cheating on him with other niggas pitching woop,
I’m the shoulder he cry on; I’m the nigga who listen to.
Despicable, 'cause this lil’ nigga, I used to fuck with,
even would’ve gave my liver to. Nah.. that isn’t true.
But anywho, I gotta lynch this fool,
throw him in hot water like instant food. Heavy line; instant “ooo”.
Y'all got him chose, I get him chewed. This bitch confused,
‘cause round here, I got the motherfucking juice. Bars. Nigga, I’m witch’s brew.
Lyrical chikka-boom, give him another hole to whistle through.
Aim that cannon(Canon), flash, steel(still) shot, no picture booth.
Holla, killing you gon hurt me way more than it’s gon get to you.

I carefully crafted these rounds. Later, give him that lyrical shower; first,
for the villain to beat the superhero, you gotta strip him off his power first.

Reality check, Holla: you are not a young star, dog.
You’re twenty-four, and in December, you just bought your first car, dog.
Reality check, Holla: you a motherfucking fraud, dog,
but nigga, you’re so fraud, you don’t even know that you’re a fraud, dog

Reality check, Holla, and I really have to check that.
You are not, I repeat, you are not from the Westside.
You’re from Hazelwood, so throw up your H, bitch, and rep that!

Reality check, Holla. Before this battle shit kicked off,
you talking to bitches? Nah. Hitting bad broads? Hah.
You ugly ass little boy, you have the swagger of a guard dog.
Reality check, Holla.
You was a part of team from St. Louis before I kicked you out that squad, dog,
for taking too many shots, Mr. Ballgame, you’re a ball hog.

Reality check, Holla. He tell niggas he had a shootout
so y'all won’t think that he weak.
But he ain’t tell you, he was shooting that rusty thirty-eight
in the air from across the street.

And the niggas he was playing with, they was gonna smoke you.
But I called and asked for a pass, 'cause you was dumb with no culture.

I ain’t wanna see you dead or in a cell, you fucking fool.
But y'all, don’t score my last two bars. That’s just what a real nigga do.

Showtiiiiiime. On everything, I show Holla some shit he never seen.
Rewrite his life movie and put a scary scream in every scene.
A couple rings out that left ‘d make a levy lean.
When it’s war, I go heavy fiend: get that pipe, I smoke anything and everything.

Your little maggot frame get a casket.
Your little average dame, get bagged and banged
What you gon do? Slide up on me like baggage claim?
I go and get that stee(a)l, little nigga, I play the passing lane.

I’m in a cocky mood.
I’m beating up on this dead meat; I’m in that Rocky mood.
So our boy dropped you,
you went and hopped on Nelly dick faster than Ashanti do.

Round Two
HITMAN HOLLA
If you know anything about Hitman,
then you should know that I don’t mess around,
and when it come to this battle shit,
I do a lot of exposing in the second rounds.

First off, I told you in advance that you never stood a chance.
I’m greeted by demand,
and you can’t pull my card 'cause the city know my hand.

Speaking of hands, you and I both know that you never got choked.
You and I both know that whole rumor was a joke.
But the shit that you did had me heated through the charts;
I'ma tell y'all the reason he ain’t come with me for Ars.

Hanz had Verb spooked, I’m talking real bad.
I called Verb every day, after school, after class,
like, “Yo, you get your ticket? It’s about to go down,”
and he said every time, “I’m online now.”

But wait. I called the night before, he ain’t even call back.
Text me in the morning on some shit like, “I'ma fall back.”
If that ain’t phony or shady, then what you call that?
Respect that I once had for you, I want it all back.

Let me talk to this nigga, man.
Nobody give a fuck that your resume with the heavyweights
when you walk around with a heart that belong with featherweights.

Verb, nobody give a fuck that you fucking all of the ladies
when every battle rapper consider you as a lady.

Verb. And the nigga that protect you not gon come and help you,
or come to your rescue, 'cause I’m his nephew.

So all that guap game gon protect you? That’s so not the case,
‘cause where the fuck was Chase when you was getting chased?
You ran out of state, and punched in the face, on camera trying to escape,
man you so fucking— wait…

You mean to tell me, a nigga punched you in your mouth,
and all you did was pout? What’s that?
Now I ain’t saying walk around the city like a tough cat,
but it’s rules you learn as a kid; fuck rap.
A nigga curse you, it’s mandatory that you cuss back.
A nigga rush you, it’s mandatory that you rush back.
A nigga shoot at you, it’s mandatory that you bust back.
A nigga touch you, it’s mandatory that you touch back.

And you did a song with GSI behind Keith Wine(?) back,
and he used to give you money. Never mind, besides that,
you did some shit then showed you don’t want no contact.
GSI bombed first, when are you gon bomb back?
Let a nigga touch me. Tremaine, where them nines at?
We got ‘em. Banana clip, Mardi Gras, time strap,
(inaudible), shotgun, playboy, don’t never care.
All you here is “yett yett”, then blood flying everywhere.

I was the man at fourteen. I do what I does.
Before you battled SB, the Lou ain’t know who you was.

Limelight. We was trill, gangbanging for real. Niggas was getting killed.
We was out doing that, you was out at the Mills,
trying to sell jewelry, belts, watches, and heels,
(inaudible) on my son, I’m for real.

St. Louis, what the hell?
Y'all praise a nigga that tried to blackball Street Status from URL?

Oh, that’s on my son grandpap.
The nigga called my jack like, “Street Status is wack.
Wait 'til I call Smack; on a URL stage them niggas ‘d never rap.”
I hate to say it St. Louis, but that’s a motherfucking fact.

Aye Verb clown; this choppa ‘ll lay this nerd down
Let’s talk about that parking lot situ-uuugh. I'ma save that for the third round.

You old ass clown, just an old ass noun,
let a young nigga shine. Sit your old ass down.

AYE VERB
Now this the round when I get lyrical.
I ride up on Holla like a car, and put lead in him like a pencil.

What? Them last bars, they didn’t stick like that?
But y'all scream and go crazy when he say shit like that.

Explain me this 'cause I don’t get it yet.
You rep Westside, Blood gang, 50-100 block, (Kates) and (Isrite),
right? Right? But how? 'Cause little nigga, that’s a Crip set.

But let me guess, since you do so much Westsiding and bloop-blooping,
that they just gon let you Soo-woop it, right?
Bitch, you sound stupid.

It’s sucka in you Holla, real niggas can read that shit.
Plus it’s coward in you too, 'cause you bleed that shit.
I ride on niggas like a gangster with just me, that’s it.
If this was football, I’d be Barry Sanders. You’d be Emmitt Smith.
'Cause you run behind your block; I don’t need that shit.

If I catch him outside and tell this bitch nigga, “man up,”
he gon’ be like, “mannn..” Man, what?
“I’m just saying Verb, on my mama, ball game
Wait 'til my mama get here. Wait 'til my mama get here.”

Man, shut up little nigga, you ain’t reckless. You bang? Never.
I’m a one-man slave special, get your whole gang wet up.
I come to you first, then all they cribs: I’m like a chain letter.

You on that sizzy? Look, brother, this my house, heathen.
You lizard looking motherfucker. Mouse eater.

How you gon stand here and belittle niggas,
when you run around screaming, “you see me” for Murphy Lee?
Don’t nobody see him, so you just a little nigga’s little nigga.

I’m a grown man, Holla. I’m almost 30, a boss.
You ain’t street; they think you street because you dirty and dark.
You ain’t a killer, you a dolphin: you just related to sharks.

I grab that eagle, let it fly until that birdy get lost.
Fuck it, be soft, dog. Mardi Gras parade in reverse:
I throw something, he catch it, and then it take his top off.
This lyrical hot sauce, should I stop? Nah, watch:

I made you and I made me.
They see you and be like “who?” They see me and be like “G.”

The club play you, but they pay me, so where the fuck is your fame?
It’s like I was playing Mortal Kombat on Sega Genesis with your career,
and pressed A, B, A, C, A, B, B, 'cause I put blood in the game.

Now let that marinate. My spot permanent, it’s very straight
Slow it down. My spot perm in it; it’s very straight
You a ground-level featherweight
fucking with a heavyweight that can mid-round levitate.
Forty got seventeen; you take five like I told you take a break.

Nah, let’s take that back.
He say I’m over the hill. Damn, ain’t that strange.
I come with a gun that’s Grant’s age.
Scope on it, go on a rampage, and get to shooting from Durant range.
Big boy bars. Stay in your ant lane.

Round Three
HITMAN HOLLA
Knock, knock. You know what that mean, I’m back on my bullshit.
Bow. They say they want the Hitman back; I’m on my old shit.

Now I’m in his crib, his granny up by her toes shit.
Where his newborn? I stuff him up in the stove shit.
Auntie throat slit, yeah, out of control shit. Oh shit,

Ars treatment.

What up, Chaz? With all them weapons and them things you shoot,
I saw that footage and you got some explaining to do.
How many niggas chased you, was it two?
Some brown skin nigga with waves, was it you?

The camera don’t lie, if you watch and see.
It’s some URL battle rap nigga running through a park again.
People, his name start with a C.

Fuck it, let’s get straight to the facts, Verb.
Them niggas that chased you is right by that bar.
Go ahead, chase them niggas back, Verb.

Smack, you got (inaudible) of them guns, you better warn him.
I ain’t saving no more rappers, I’m killing all them.
I load up that Mac like I’m putting air in a Spalding.
Blaow. Run up on me, you leave crawling.
I’m eating real well. I could tell you starving.
But fuck rap, let’s get it on: Marvin.
Niggas know the deal, I’m too Ill. Marlon,
he’s soft. He see me and change up like a Marlin.

(inaudible) baddest. I came up the fastest,
but fuck top tier, give me that underdog status.
I walked in, hugs from the bitches. The baddest.
He walked in, tragic. No looks: Magic.
(inaudible), I’m a motherfucking savage.
For(‘fore) the Bills, I turn into a Gator like Brandon.

All this battle rapping and you broke? No bank account on Chase?
Saint Louis, slow it down.
I said all this battle rapping and he broke, no bank. Aye count on Chase.

A nigga swung on me when I had a cast on, my foot was just broke,

The test was, could I kill you beautifully and leave here without a bruise on me.
You ain’t moving me. Bitch get worried;
my last round was your obituary. This one is your eulogy.

Holla, seventy-five percent of black fathers don’t even visit.

I been to your crib many times. That shit roses and bubbles.
I watched your momma hug you. But your father doesn’t love you.

‘Cause he let you be a sucker.
When a father loves his son and the son means the world to the father,

like, “Listen, your name Gerald. Let’s chill with all this Holla.

You a athlete with no rap sheet.
You ain’t ever clip rounds or bust a zip down, hoe sit down.

You ain’t never been in a dope house where the dope fiends smoke up,
see that thick cloud, smell that aroma, and almost throw up.

You ain’t never had to hustle, get a pack and swear it came from the border,

You need a system, and assistance, to beat me in this ring. In fact,
here's a tip: bars ain’t enough to kill me. You better bring a strap.
Here's another tip: don't rewind none of your lines and try and bring it back,
you copy? Now you stuck with a couple pointers like a Chinese finger trap.
See the thing is that, besides this battle, you ain't got shit to lose.
What you gon do, say that I'm boring and I make niggas snooze?
Say I stole my whole style from you, but you came with some iller moves,
then use bars from up and comers, and say that's the shit that Chilla do?

That's too predictable. It's like your obsessed with me, oddly.
I bet, you've played this matchup out in your dreams probably.
I'm just tryna beat my last performance; it seems cocky,
got to make sure the punches heavy, the schemes godly.
But you really think I'm focused on Q.P.? Hardly.
I ain’t even see this bitch on the card; I’m Steve Harvey.

Copy. I know some people say I sound like you,
but I will never be a mutherfucking clown like you.
Bosstown.

QP
Who wore the pants that Chilla wore today? Nobody. Nigga you Keith Sweating.
You in a tight(s) situation. Nigga, these leggings.
Speaking of these leggings, you probably had to to squeeze each leg in.

It’s nothing to chalk and outline these squares; that’s hopscotch.
With that Tommy, he’ll figure(Hilfiger) it out as soon as it crop tops.

Nigga, you won’t beat me. Rain, sleet, hail, snow, nigga, hell no. Under no conditions.
Not Chilla the stealer. What we fitting to talk about? I suppose it’s snitching?
What we talking ‘bout, nigga?
The coke addiction, the hoes, the pimping, the ghosting, tripping, the stolen chicken,
what we talking ‘bout, nigga?
Swave wilding out(Wild’n Out), Con, the other Khan, the Jew, Soul ‘ll visit,
what we talking ‘bout, nigga?

The Maury Show, the story goes how I had my hoe and both my twins,
and, what we talking ‘bout, nigga?
To separate from yellow tape in the second day and roll in bricks,
and how ‘bout we talk about

the cab he came in, the tax he claiming, and how he been so dependent,
and how he call himself Kingpen ‘cause behind bars, nigga, you known for snitching.
See, I(C.I.) know you’ll roll over on your co-defendant for a lower sentence;
he hates to steal bars, but don’t judge him, ‘cause he do it with no conviction.

Nigga, you’re not top tier at Smack anymore; I’m not trying to offend you.
Smack gave you life on Easy Street based on the comp that they give you.
Last guy, you didn’t have to study for. Prep, he had scholar potential.
Then they gave you another no-name; what was his name?
Oh yeah, Th3 Saga continues.

QP-vs-cHilla-QP-solo
They say this clown got the “It” juice, something I couldn’t ignore.
In my head, dice rolling, like I done seen this woofing before.
No, in my Head ICE role, and, I done seen this Wolfing before.
He think he unruly ‘cause he battle niggas with one foot in the door.
Nigga, I was booking whooping before slaving, long before you ever got a boat ride.
I was Hanz on the way over, out of control; my hands were on the boat tide.
I was Prepping to Smack you new niggas out of your boat ties
way before you prepped to smack NuNu’s nigga out of his bowtie.

Both eyes on my pupil, I had to examine your past.
You were in that loner boat, you know, where every friend(-)ship skips past.
Too shy to raise his arm and lift a hand in a clash;
you got to understand that he bash..ful, a personality that a mannequin has.
Nigga, I’ma show you how to liven it up, nigga. And with the swag,
lookit, lyrically and physically with the punches and with pizzazz.
Get it? Lyrically with the punches and.. with pizzazz,
but physically with the punches and.. whip his ass?
Nigga, you looking for gore, then(Gordon) I’ll be back in a Flash.
I’ll leave this gig, then come right back in a Flash,
like, “remember me?” See, now, timing’s what I happen to have;
I’ma keep it G real with you, cuz.

Round Two
CHILLA JONES
When I went to Angryfan’s Facebook group, and I seen niggas in there dissed me,
I hit up Angryfan like, “Get me on air quickly.
I need you to set up the next show and get it clear with me.”
Then I thought about it. These niggas only use scandals to keep your ears busy.
They don't want the truth; they want the ratings. They don't care really,
so I switched up, like fuck it, 'cause Angryfan ain't gon play fair with me.
Maybe I'm bi(-)polar, and don't pan the(Panda) camera.
I'ma answer all the rumors you hear swiftly.
Been on my grizzly, but be coo’; I’ll a(koala)ddress it, just bear with me.

Yeah, dig me. If it seems like I'm giving off a murder vibe,
it’s 'cause I want to steal on you for the verbal lies that you verbalized.
But why waste a punch?
If he sees me throw a duke, he dropping. My hands certified,
shit. But thats a synonym scheme:
Why (waste) a punch? If (feces) me throw a (dookie dropping). My hands certified,
Truth is, he's deterred(turd) by the shit 'cause I’m a newer(manure) breed,
but he prefer the lies(fertilize).
Every battle I put on a show, from the moment that the curtains rise,
cursing life’s curses and writing verses til it hurts inside.
For what it's worth,
shit I know what it look like to y’all. I admitted that when I first denied,
but it was so ridiculous to me at first, it wasn't worth replies,
as most of y’all dismissed it, and it climbed up in it's hearse to die,
QP used his energy to keep the controvers’ alive.
He analyzed every worded line to see what he could search and find,
and, what a shocker. Over twenty-five battles, some coincidences occurred; it's fine,
but now y’all think I watch battles from smaller leagues and research for lines,
which is absurd, but y'all doubt me on my word, like it's the perfect lie.
This clown should be in the circus. He ain't what he seem on the surface side.
If y'all can’t tell he has a motive or a purpose why, then your circuits fried.

Y'all thought this perp ‘ll(purple) slide,
like I ain't gon' black on him? That would be a blunder.
After you brown-nosed Angryfan, my angry fans began to tweet a brother,
then something I read(red) blew(blue) me away, ‘bout how you steal deposits.
Aren’t(orange) you the one taking green from others?
But I ain't gon yell o(yellow)ver the shit.
Just know if we collide, a scope(kaleidoscope)’ll have you seeing colors.

QP-vs-Chilla-lyrics-C-shout
I know; those bars were basic and inferior for rhymers,
but everything ain't for the cam, y’all.
I brought a color scheme for the room like interior designers.
Here's a reminder: you go hard, but I go harder.
Think you can win? I don't fault ya, but I don't falter.
You just follow my every move like a psycho stalker.
Now you’re career’s on the line like a tightrope walker.

I'm gon chalk ya. This how karma do you.
If your angel here(hair), alarm your boo boo,
And if she prego, then I’m airing near her(marinara) stomach, drawing two tools.
It's shells over sauce when what I pull is on ya(lasagna) noodle.

How come every time you pen a(penne) line,
you act like I'm the best impostor(pasta)?
Well I'll put bucks in the stock, nigga, show you how to invest a dollar.
Did that shock you? Oh well. I'm just trying to send a message proper,
then I'm shocking your dogs’ necks like electric collars.

Holler back. I’ll follow, you and your Miss, Q. I won't miss. <Qwoo, Qwoo>
No miscue. They'll be saying, “we miss Q.”

The pistol I wave move crews(cruise) and leave them sea sick;
the ratchet lick a(liquor) shot off the body like a freak bitch,
not to mention, if I’m at(@) you with a sub, it ain’t a sneak diss.
It’ll sit you down just to pick you up like a ski lift.

This the Kingpen. Y’all think he going vers’ me for the name?
My shit is Magic; he just trying to prove he Worthy in the game.
Play hero(-)in(e) O.D. for trying to murder me in vain(vein),
and get bucks from the pound like currency exchange.

I’m insane. I know some people say I sound like you,
but I will never be a motherfucking clown like you.
Bosstown.

QP
Y’all indecisive on that first round? That’s what you make of Q?
If I lift the cal(cow) on him, is that still debatable(bull)?

I ain’t Mickey, this ain’t Disney, but I came many(Minnie) of miles on him.
Your click ain’t got a father figure for any, then I’ll son them.
I’ll sit your whole circle down while spinning around on him;
you know, duck, duck, goose, you know, Indian style on him.

We clocking these rounds on a old timer or a watch? Nigga, let’s decide.
Against Daylyt I got cut a minute short. That’s sixty seconds; fine.
Go against the agreement here, and I get anything less than time,
and I get stopped, watch and get clocked, soon as I get pressed for time.

Nigga, your techs and nines?
I don’t want to hear your about your fucking bars with a gun; it’s a fable.
I know you gon ignore the shit and rap about the shit one minute later.
I’m the DJ: every time, I’m in the club with a banger.
I got a revolver so big, when it’s slugs in the changer,
I need a court recess for me just judging its chambers.

Aim at y’all necks, Friday, done. I’m already on the move with
my cousin, for the record, shopping: I’m Craig on his new trip.
J.J., Dede, remember the chocolate Payday story he told Roach after only two hits?
That just go to show you, like Craig, since a kid, I been on that pool shit.

Brew wits; potions, elixirs, shots. Potions, remedy;
shit that’ll play with your mind, and invoke you mentally.
I’ll unfriend you on Facebook, my nigga, then come poke you physically,
then hold a spoon to your open wound to add insult(salt) to injury.

QP-vs-Chilla-lyrics-QPshout
He say, “See, like my GPS, I ain’t never lost.”
See, it’s lines like that, and robbing like a bitch, I should Set It Off.
For wilding, I should hire a hitman and pay the extra cost,
‘cause you’d be more beneficial dead. What’s that? Better offed.
I had to head east to find a bird this soft; faster foes peep.
He didn’t want to take me. He’s piano lessons: ask him low key.
Nigga, but I text him all caps with a mad emoji,
trying to back out. I made him do it. Chilla, now that’s a cold feat(feet).

This nigga came in the game fronting the Kingpen;
see old Jerome here the same as Ross.
How you get here with the RICO, nigga, when you never paid the cost?
I don’t buy bull(bible); that’s ungodly. Pray; I just can’t exhault.
They call me GodPen, ‘cause this is how Jesus would’ve came across.

I pray to god: I say, “it’s through you I do everything.” Yep, that’s what I told the lord.
They say me and him in the same boat, when we ain’t even close for sure(shore).
I’m the captain; skip a nigga who ain’t never been on a boat before.
No, I’m the captain, skipper, nigga. Who ain’t never been on a boat before?
Is C(sea) sick? ‘Cause now I see a nigga going overboard.

Lock you up, close the doors, nigga, you taking the charge.
C.O. Jerome here probably think he’s safe with the guards.
Nigga, you catching wreck in the bathroom, or it’s straight to the yard.
You KingPen, but you ain’t Chapo, you not escaping this bars.

Now that was fire; I was gonna chill, but shit, I’m just getting warmed up,
I mean I swear. It’s gon be the first time somebody in jail got smoked;
you KingPen in this joint? Good. Take this L(el), Chapo.

Nigga, you always come with the toy lit(toilet); by now you’d think it was seeking.
You like Dot with the punches how you always reach at the peak end.
You always doing a stretch. I guess it’s ‘cause you think you a KingPen,
but this nigga probably wake up from sleep and he’s scheming.

This nigga wake up, fold your blanket before you go and get a coffee,
put on your white Iversons, say some shit like, “Yo, this shit is saucy.”
Nigga you walk around reaching all day. I know it get exhausting.
You walk through a plethora of butterflies like, “Yo, get ‘em off me, get ‘em off me.”

You what Chilla told me? Beat him, become a winner. My climate would then feel
like my fans be through the roof; oo. Nice, it’s a win(d) mill.
You crack me up. What’re(water) you thinking? That’s ice on the windshield.
I don’t know how cold your goal is, but mine is win(d), Chill.

You got lost and found yourself in somebody else’s jacket
when you got out the freeze.
You taking raps off-hand; cut the crap. This is how you thief,
running with that jester, you’re a clown to me.
Go ahead and steal(steel) all around to the point they got to crown you king.

I’ll use commercial transportation to try to help explain his fault.
Him and his crews(cruise) in the same boat, washed up, never taking off.
That carry-on line you stole from Big T? Nigga, plain(plane) was cough.
When you bus(t) a flow, it’s with somebody else’s train of thought.

Round Three
CHILLA JONES
Until now, every league that tried to set this up, I refused it.
I only took you, 'cause I said in my head, “Fuck it, it's time to do it.”
Y'all say my luck’s(Lux) up like he gon show up with a coffin and put me right into it.
I tuned it out. For the record, I juke boxes like diner music.

If he lose it, he'll say New York is biased, so why should Brooklyn choose him?
He said his battles, I look and viewed them
for techniques, then I took and used them.
Y’all seen Q lend e’rry(culinary) art to me, right?
Now watch me cook and(cooking) school him.

This crook foolin y'all. For that, I’ll make his life span shorter.
I don’t like you. You a dishonest, pill-popping gram snorter.
You say a lot of shit about the boy up on them camcorders,
but now that we adjacent, state them(Jason Statham) like the Transporter.

Lemme state mines. I don't like how every year his crew switch.
You came in repping SONS, now you found other dudes to move with,
then you got all buddy buddy with Born, on some new(Nu) shit;
nowadays it's Qleen in(cleaning) his ear givin Q tips.

Truth is, shit never ends in your crew’s favor.
Where was the bail money when Bonnie got Booked?
When Born was couch hopping, where was Nu’s(news) paper?
Remy owed money out in St. Louis.
He was ducking Magazines from them tool sprayers,
but Bro sure(brochure) act like getting money is in they true nature,

Fronting like your groups major. Innuendo.
Where if you ain’t with it then we… in ya window,
but if you with it when it’s finished, in the end you win dough.
The kid’s getting spanked by the ruler; I ain’t a N-U-N though.
I made it though to see a scenario where in the end you win though.
I mean your second round was fire, but no I’m bout to smoke QP.
Shit, I guess in the end you endo.

A pin code: I’m money on these battle rap stages.
Your baby moms already expose your battle rap wages.
I bet you brought every punch in your notebook, back to back pages.
But you make twelve hundred a year off battle rap.
You should go back to Backpages,

Outrageous. Every year you out here snitching and saying names,
creating scandals for your peers for a quick few days of fame,
and meanwhile, you rely on being an escort for making change.
Your Backpage ads say, "If you're male, it's extra.” What’s “extra”?
And I ain't playing games.
He gave his old bitch an STD, left her burning, and she hate the pain.
That's why his ex-ting wish a(extinguisher) big can would spray the flame.

It's lame. So what you gon say? I should hit you up for ghostwriting,
'cause there's a lot of things you can help me with?
Nigga you suck dick for money. As far as I'm concerned, you can't tell me shit.

You unhealthy bitch. I’ma show y'all this fiend is stupid.
I’ll take him(Kim) to my connect out in Brooklyn,
figure out which door he in(Dorian) and lead them through it,
and I'll be Frank like, "Q came Miles, and L(Andell)’s ain't working;
the weed is useless.
He took an X pill on the way here, so, shit, I figure a little mo’ E sh’(Moesha) do it.”

I told you, my man a modern day Escobar.
Then I left, and he got swarmed by the set so hard,
they took his sneaks, took his phone, even his metro card,
so you could say I played Q better than Fredro Starr.

Bars. But I ain't tryna call cops to arrest Q,
I told y'all I came for the kill. I'ma rest Q.
Let's go. Fresco better come to your rescue.

It's true. I'm a big dog, ready to crash barriers;
ironic how your name is Qleen but you back terriers(bacterias).

He scarier than most, but you could lie some more,
acting like you a gangsta that bring rivals war.
Who put batteries your back? Check his spinal cord,
you’ll look and(N) see(C) double A’s like the Final Four.

Lord. It’s a new day fam,
so when you think who got the juice,
put my face in the picture(pitcher) like the Kool-Aid Man.

Damn. You thought you would win, and that's why you losing now,
but what did you expect Q? You always been a loser clown.
It's time you should retire, 'cause we all seen you lose a round
against Mr. Jump-to-Top-Tier-from-the-Proving-Grounds.
Bosstown.

QP
Go ‘head, Chilla. I only do coke, and you keep trying to say it’s crack.
Keep bringing up the male escorting shit; well bitch, you fitting to pay for that.

So you a writer and Uber driver. Kick your shit into gear.
You battled me ‘cause you said your daughter had a wishlist this year.
So you hook her(hooker) up with Jon Dough; now you the pimp it appears.
My gift happens to be why your daughter gets Christmas this year.

This shit just gets weird,
I mean, battle rapping it, taxi cabbing it, I don’t know many that would.
But if the pay is what you say, then I guess really he should.
I mean, you’re jobless; it’s a fair opportunity, there’s ain’t plenty of joobs.
I’ll spell it out for Chill, a J-O, any(N-E) is(S) good.

And when he in hoods, you got to understand it looks
a little weird you in your rear-view as each demand getting took.
I ain’t talking Smack, but I got a ‘ac, nigga, where you can get booked.
You make an arm and a leg just walking on people hand and foot.

This man chin, look. Before I even start rapping in here,
I got to address Chilla’s unsuitable razor bumps; they been slacking for years.
All’s well that ends swell; that’s what’s happening here.
Did the keloids crawl down from the back of your ear?
Got to your jaw like, “All right, start unpacking, we’re here.”
Did that get under your skin? Good, nigga, it matches your beard.

As it appears, you’ve been faced with a bunch of hard bumps.
Are you abreast that under your neck maybe you got a couple large lumps?
I’ma box you then re-box you and let you attach a large pump
to connect the dots on the neck you got to that Lettie Debbie Star Crunch.

Nigga them shits is juice pack fruit snacks; every one he cut gushes.
The goat’s girl got, it’s got a little bumpy, but fuck her,
I mean, she like, you know how it be. I know your honey must suffer
when morning sex expose your neck.
What’s she see when your honey nut? Clusters.

I’ll bump the goat right here. I’m just waiting for this shit to pop.
I make the swipe, pussy, break out. Just know that this pimp ‘ll(pimple) knot
the side of your head. Slow it down. Oo. Those are temple shots.
Get it? Slow it down, the side of your head: those are both temples. Hot.

Simple thought. You Uber-smart. Not only cabbing, but you hype hype.
Lot hype like your favorite song is rapping.
Nigga, Qleen popping with me;
two-choppa ‘sembly. When these chrome is clapping,
both them bitches singing. That’s Tamar and Toni Braxton.
We’ll turn the inside of your whip into a Queenzflip song reaction.

He known for snatching. Nothing original about none of your raps.
Umbilical cord: boy, you could see sons(SONS) is attached.
Then you copy like a bitch, and got the stomach to match.
Nigga them razor bumps the only time you’ve made something from scratch.

Nigga you fucked with a cat who ain’t fucked with; it's cap.
Nigga, he beat his self, it’s the same.
You call yourself Chilla still(steal), nigga, that in itself it explains.
You KingPen? That’s got to be the most selfish of claims.
Don’t shy(Chi) away from these two L’s, ey(A), I’m spelling your name.

Nigga, you fell in a grave, stealing shit. Kid that you morbidly would do.
The flows you’re taking’s your motivation and forcibly the muse.
It’s hard to digest; I just, upchuck orally when you
come up on up-and-comers like fifty-eight names who don’t normally get views.
But it’s the Patriot Act; see, his game tape’s getting formally reviewed.
Catching up to you, I guess you bit off more than you could chew.

If you beat me a round, I’ll retire. No flipping word-spin.
I’ll retire, as in, nigga, no longer working.
I got to win every round; my career’s going on thirty.
No; I’ma win every round. My career’s going on. Thirty.
Qleen Paper on Traphouse: nigga, I ain’t showing no mercy.

First thing’s first thing. W on my porch, don’t be stupefied,
especially taking my steps to blow up; nigga, you using mine.
You coke reaching; I start teaching the moment I toot a line.
They call me GodPen, ‘cause cross me, and Jesus, you’ll get crucified.

So, they're like, “Soul, you think Caustic’s gonna play you for a mark?”
Doesn't matter. This’ll be the last battle they do on the card.
Then I seen we’re on day one. This should’ve been day two from the start,
‘cause if he try punk me, we’ll have to host day 2 in a park.

‘Cause I ain't fuckin scared of you, and I don't care how hard I hit.
I don't care how big you are and I don't care who started it,
‘cause when Bigg K put it on him, we seen him start to shit
and make more excuses for the third round than Charlie Clips.

Like, “Listen to me, K. Listen to me, K.”
Your voice is filled with broken glass; how'd we listen to it break?
I mean, we're similar in ways. We both got pushed by someone bigger than us, mate,
but the difference is you bitched out and I hit you in the face.

So b-b-b-bully who? You think I'm actually shook of you?
Well I’m not, cause you'd bully him, but theres no way that he'd bully you.
And they say you're not a bully anymore ‘cause a bully bullied you,
but you pick and choose who you bully, and that’s exactly what bullies do.

So he's gonna try intimidate me, and I’ll just stand staring.
I don’t know who the fuck that this man thinks this man scaring.
But being overly offensive ain't really my— I'm playing,
translation: he’ll get wopped in his boat like his grandparents

Soul-vs-Caustic-Lyrics-Soul-spitting
You think that’s racist? I used to visit my grandad for a cup of tea.
You can't visit your grandad without a fucking fleet of submarines.
Your baby mum is peak. Guess that’s some shit she never learned before.
Your whole ancestry died on the boat, why the fuck she still got scurvy for?
She's like your great grandmum, ‘cause she a dirty whore with herpes sores,
and a bloated up guido that washed up on Jersey shore.

Further more, your kid’s ugly. Stop posting pictures with that little bitch.
She fell out the ugly tree, hit every single twig, then got pistol whipped.
I got a next bar, and the RSPCA are gonna be pissed at this,
but when she gets older, you’re gonna need a lot of makeup for that guinea pig.

No man will ever wanna be with her.
Oh wait, its a boy? That’s even worse.

It’s no surprise. Look at how that faggoty wop’s been reared.
His mum’s strang out on rock with Cadalack Ron,
and you’re just mad ‘cause she copped his gear.
She’s like the Fourth Birthday bouncer, ‘cause she got sacked from her job this year.
She went cable and they were like, “Damn, she's the nastiest dog in here.”

CAUSTIC
He’s talking shit about my son.
Those are some great bars. I mean, that was fucking great man.
I mean, what are you gonna fight him next?
I’m pretty sure you’re in his weight class.

I’m in a whole nother league, so it don’t matter what you say,
‘cause you were only good for one event: you’re like Battle of the Brave.
And I don’t want to spend the whole fucking battle
talking about this shit for half a day,
so let’s go ahead and get all this obvious shit right out of the way.

Soul-vs-Caustic-Lyrics-Caustic
Do you wanna know what getting punched by you is really like?
Right before you hit me, I swear to god someone screamed “pillow fight”.
So you want to try again, go ahead and try it, bitch,
but I don’t know why you act violent,
especially when your tiny fists are fucking softer than dryer lint.

I’m kind of sick, dog, and I’m not into taking losses,
and I’ve never seen you fight, but you giving fucking excellent face massages.

You mention the fucking punch every battle. Okay, that's enough.
He’s so fucking proud of that cheap shot; you brave little cunt.
Then you fucking turned tail and ran like a bitch
‘cause I wasn't phased by the punch;
luckily for you, I know how to be the bigger man, in more ways than one.

You tried to save Jeff and you made him look weak.
You gave me your best punch and I ate that shit like a G.
If I could go back in time, I wouldn't change a thing
‘cause I’m willing to bet, if the shoe was on the other foot,
I bet that little Jeffy P wouldn’t hesitate to do the same thing to me.

That’s real shit. That’s why I’m killing this faker.
See, violence ain’t the only way that you can deal with a hater.
See, you’ve barely broke a hundred thousand views in your life,
and just to keep it real with you, player,
if I would’ve hit you back, you would’ve woke up a fucking million views later.

Look at this shit; you see that?
That’s just like your whole style, dog, it’s just fucking smoke and mirrors.
If you would’ve never hit me back then, nobody would even know you’re here.
I dictated your next move; I’m your evil overseer.
Kim Jong-un: I’ve got power over Seoul, Korea(Soul Career).

If I ever see you in the States, then I’m dropping his ass.
I’m known to dissect motherfuckers like a biology class.
I got a snub thirty-eight that’ll body this fag,
and I keep that shit on my waist like a colostomy bag.

And I forgot one, but I don’t give a fuck, ‘cause I’ll let the pistol smoke.
I’ll leave you floating in a river, bro.
My guns got a secret they promised not to tell a living Soul.

Round Two
SOUL
He said he’s got power over Seoul like Kim Jong-un. That’s the shit that he on, man?
Bruv, King Jong-un’s for North Korea. You should know that from your peon gang.

Arsonal and Verb are the two big names who have faced him
and both times, that was you replacing Shotty ‘cause he couldn't make it.

So if you ever think your’e ever fucking getting the chain,
that’s cute, but the only time the staff ever mention your name

is when Gully’s like,
"Some say Shotty isn't gonna show up, and that’s what the talk is about,”
and Organik’s like “Fuck. Is caustic around?
Well its clear… What we do here...
is take back the deposit that’s down in Shotty’s account, cause it to bounce,
then book the cokehead racist for a quarter of the amount.”
Now thats unfair… but you still there...
because you’re a clown, obviously down,
thick any chance you get
to call black people moolies without them knocking him out.

Bruv, you and Cadalack Ron have the exact same fan base.
He's like, “Come on, how can I have hate for a man’s race?
Some of my best friends wear black face.”

So when your klan mates had the word, they were pissed, G.
Heard what happened in Atlanta, that you got turned into mincemeat.
Ain’t them the ones normally that light crosses and burn Mississippi?
Then how the fuck’s the racist the one getting burned by a Big T?

Look, you called Big T a chunky monkey. Are you dumb?
Then you called John John a slave. Bruh, that’s too much.
Well you're in inner city London; they gon rush him, man, this dude’s fucked.
Open up those old wounds, they'll open up some new ones.

Listen, I talked to the rapper that sold you coke last time he was in this town.
He said he was looking at you like you look at Big T.
“Shit, that guy’s three-hundred-odd pounds.”
Then you said you wanted a discount? With what he'd snort up his snout?
If he gave you three percent off, he'd have to remortgage his house.

I'm saying nobody can take blow like their noses can.
Thrown out the club, and he don't play Kotal Khan.
He had to change soda brands, ‘cause he bought bare Cola cans,
and not one single one of them would share coke with Dan.

CAUSTIC
You said your homie sold me coke; that’s just amusing to me.
I mean, have you ever fucking met me in your life?
Everybody knows I only do it if it’s free.

You clearly not the tough guy that you clearly pretended to be.
I’ll never accept defeat from some little weirdo with yellow teeth.
We may be cool tomorrow, but tonight, I’m here as your enemy.
I only came to cross the line like Syrian refugees.

Soul-vs-Caustic-Lyrics-Caustic2
Nice overbite, Shorty Spice.
Why you picking on me for? Maybe you want to try someone more your size.
He’s the cheap victory type. I know the type.
He’s the sort of guy that picks Oddjob every time on GoldenEye.
No proximity mines, he goes straight for the golden gun stage.
I met you before; I know this fuckface.
Are you this ugly all the time, or you going through a rough phase?
You got Kurt Cobain’s hair and Courtney Love’s face.

So it’s Fresh Coast. Your pen game - less dope.
Real men don’t watch Death Note.
Your whole persona’s based on some Japanese kids’ show.
Little bitch, I bet you get your hair done by Fresco.

What’s it like being a bitch, dog? I’m asking for a friend.
He writes a couple bars about cartoons and he’s a savage with the pen,
so, welcome to another episode of “Anime with Jed”.
Or maybe he’s gonna tell us about the time he went to Canada.. again.

Oh, and you made a friend. Oh, he’s in a long-distance relationship.
Be honest, bro, how fucking stupid do you feel every time you say that shit?
No? They’re called groupies, dog,
you aren’t supposed to wife them up and date the bitch.
The only reason he even still talks to Organik
is ‘cause he can’t afford to pay for trips.
Don’t you find it strange as shit that you and you girl’s whole relationship
is based on whenever the next World Domination is?

You’re five foot three, with fucked up teeth; who wouldn’t want to get with you?
I mean it’s Jed Mitchell.
His girlfriend blew more guys in ninety minutes than a Chelsea ref whistle.

He still try to tell people that he’s really the headliner.
Just ‘cause you lost to Cee Major doesn’t mean it’s okay to F Minors.

Oh, you don’t like it when I talk about your girl. What you staring at, bitch?
She’s sixteen years old, you can’t marry that bitch.
Every rapper in Toronto been sharing that bitch.
I will EMC / Mac Sherry that bitch.
You can’t cross the threshold; you can’t carry that bitch.
I got a Glock nineteen and I carry that bitch.
I will Ol’D.B. / Mariah Carey that bitch.
I will Bruce Almighty Jim Carey that bitch.

Round Three
SOUL
If you buy into his shit, then you’re basically an idiot.
You’re talking about the shit I did; let’s talk about what I didn’t, bitch.
I didn’t switch on Arcane to get in with Diz; that’s snitchy shit.
I didn’t bullied into a Twitter bitch; that’s bitchy shit.
I didn’t think, “I’ll battle my good friend, then bring up his
dead homie, then shit my fucking pants when he say he’ll split my shit.”
That’s all bitch-made shit he did since our little incident,
but he wants to call me a little bitch? For swinging fists? That’s ridiculous.
“Aw, my daddy died when I was five.” Yeah, no fucking shit he did.
You wouldn’t be such a fucking spineless faggot if he lived.
Mister “it’s just words, it’s just words,” to cover up his ignorance,
then spit some shit sniffling, voice quivering; you’re a hypocrite.

Soul-vs-Caustic-Lyrics-Soul2
But no doubt your kid’ll grow up fucking well-adjusted,
fucking weekend dad taking him out in the car that he’s selling drugs in.
Can’t take him on holiday ‘cause you know you won’t get through customs,
but you can get busted
cheating on your wife the same day you battled Jeff in London.
Oh… This shit just got incredibly real.
Bruv, you want me to list off all the named that you attempt to conceal?
Talk about that phone call at Bam’s house; turn into the wrestling heel?
That’s what faggots like you do. This is real-life incredibly real.
This is your daddy being dead to you real.
Growing up without a father, and how you’re still effected by it real.
Being too young to even fucking make sense of it real;
doing the same shit to the kid that you’re a blessing to real.
Now that’s depressingly real.
Think about it: no father figure, juvenile detention appeals,
now you’re grown-up, weapons to peel, fucking heroine deals,
trying to avoid that second possession-with-intent sentence appeal.
I’ll do you one better: growing up with a fucking single mother prepping his meals.
Growing up with the same scars you have that never would heal.

CAUSTIC
Well, that was fucking amazing. Look at this fucking guy, he’s literally shaking.
I mean, I think he only choked ‘cause he got nervous trying to picture me naked.

I wrote the book on this disrespect shit, dog. ‘Bout to open a chapter.
Cold as Alaska. Four-four leave your fucking dome in the rafters.
This is the final testament for anyone who said Soul been a factor.
Nah. Everything I write Will get money left behind, now that’s a sole benefactor.

Can’t fuck with me. Roll publicly with cold cutlery,
might get yourself stuck-up for acting so uppity.
No touching me; my whole company roll up with me.
Soul stole Loe’s whole flow so comfortably.
Claiming you fathered the style when you don’t even got sole(Soul) custody.

And your hoe knows what’s up with me. Tell that bitch I got some sperm to swallow.
You ‘bout to get knocked out your Timeline,
and not to Mention I got your Bird to follow.
This Soul faggot’s been acting sick; he’s not coming into work tomorrow,
or ratchets like Volkswagens: the death of Jed’ll(Jetta) be a German model.

All you talk about is The fucking Wire, every battle.
That’s where you get your little criminal raps;
his hero’s Omar, gay gangster that took dick in his ass.

You may be the champ over here, but to me, you a rookie still.
I’m more of a Sopranos guy. Talking through the wire ‘ll get this Big Pussy killed.

And now, unfortunately, there’s something I got to mention, y’all.
I mean, Soul always been on the up and up,
but after I saw this, I had to second guess him, y’all.
Somebody linked me to a post that you posted on a forum
and I can’t help but read it all,
where you went into detail about how you suffer from depression
and one day you almost tried to end it all.

What kind of depression? Could you picture him crying and stressing?
Giving all kinds of confessions to some licensed physician inside of sentence;
I swear to god,
every time you’ve attempted suicide it’s just another cry for attention,
but I find it pathetic,
‘cause there’s no such thing as a suicide attempt.
You either wanted to die or you didn’t.

You got problems with your life? Just accept that shit.
You crying about suicide online? I don’t get that shit.
Kill your fucking self. I don’t respect that shit.
Go somewhere and shoot your fucking self like a webcam bitch.

Your fate’s already been decided.
I mean the whole thought process behind it, it’s weak-minded.
I suggest you fucking fucked up the first time, then you re-try it.
If the noose slipped, then you get back on the chair and you re-tie it.

So why you talking to me?
I mean, you proved three years ago you ain’t boxing with me.
You almost bodied yourself, you’re supposed to body me?
Next time you try to kill yourself,
remember, it’s down the road, not across the street.

You are fucking pathetic. Pity party for one.
Go ahead and go home to your home Fife,
‘cause that whole fight says a lot about you, bro;
you’ve been running from your problems your whole life.

There’s nothing wrong with being a felon that’s proud of his skin type.
Ask Miklo. I may be white on the outside, but I’m brown on the inside.

You don’t compare to Ron.
I seem sleazy, but this scene needs me.
Me and G.T. go together like slamming coke and hero-on.
I’m more gangster than a O.G. parolee O.D.ing,
watching a whole season of Gangland marathon.

Well what do you know? It’s that kid from the message boards.
I never noticed, but I know this:
your nose is almost as stretched as most of your metaphors.

You’re an awkward blog nerd, hoping to be the dude that got Ron.
If you got served by Okwerdz, you’d brag about it on Rapmusic dot com.

Lush, you didn’t tell me this was a two-on-one battle; that’s scandalous, bro,
‘cause I can easily dismantle your flows, but I don’t know if I can handle that nose.

CAUSTIC
Cadalack doesn’t have a lot of black friends,
‘cause usually the first impression is bad.
But it doesn’t help that your car’s registered tags are small Confederate flags,
which is strange, ‘cause your voice sounds like your imitating a Mexican man.
Even your white supremacist dad said that you robbed Rheteric bad.

Which reminds me: Dear Diary,
it’s Ron again. Over the summer I got into extreme dieting.
I find drugs like speed enlightening,
not to mention the fact that it makes me run at the speed of lightning.
When the police chase me now it’s not even frightening,
and when I sleep on the sidewalk I can’t even feel the mosquitos bite me.
It’s been hard to raise money for drugs since my parents cut me off entirely;
I had a job selling used cars for my dad, but he fired me.
Okay, I have to go now; it’s getting hard for me to keep writing these,
‘cause I only get fifteen minutes on the computer in the library.

See that? Homeless people are easy targets. You probably sleep in a park so often,
after this the Bar Exam squadron’s going to have to bury you in a cardboard coffin.

Round Two
CADALACK RON
Look at this hockey team reject.
I’m the biggest monster you’ve seen yet. You got no offensive reflex.
So when I sock him in the face and the blood gets his beak wet,
don’t sweat. It’s won’t matter; he’s sponsored by Kleenex.

You’re the fake impostor version of Real Deal, with Soul Khan’s nose.
At the last gurp-out, I laid some lines out,
and this motherfucker’s nostrils stole Ron’s blow.

Whoa. How does that shnoz even sit on kid’s face?
How do you keep your head straight, and what’s your strategy
from keeping your center of gravity from having to be displaced?
Everyone knows this bitch is a big fake, you Union City disgrace,
so I guess it’s no mistake you didn’t get any space on the new Fresh Coast mixtape.

Fuck a mixtape, you never made a real CD.
He used to practice his thizz face
just in case he fulfilled his dreams of being on Treal TV.

Everything they say is true. I been making moves and paying dues
ever since you were in skater shoes practicing your Mortal Kombat Raiden moves.

CAUSTIC
You worship H.T., bitch. After this you’re probably going to buy us some beers.
How you going to diss the Hockey Team?
It looks like you’ve been hitting the fucking ice for years.

Yeah, you got some quotes,
but the fact that you go to Narcotics Anonymous is a joke.
How come when somebody offers you dope,
you can’t control yourself like a responsible adult?

You dropped out of Hollywood High, to walk around Hollywood high.
If any of y’all got a blowjob on Santa Monica Drive, it was probly a guy.

Your parents said your intervention was an embarrassing arrangement,
‘cause halfway through it you fell asleep on the stairs,
naked, with nothing but your hair for a blanket.

When the Jungle starts shooting people up, watch Ron get excited.
You fucking junkie, let’s just hope they amputate the arm that you write with.

Welcome to the league, faggot. You’re now rapping with the finest.
This dumb fuck learned his A-B-C’s from contracting hepatitis.

And when will this mutant realize that it’s the heroine melting down your face?
You’re a grownup now, Ron, it’s time to wear your fucking belt around your waist.

Round Three
CADALACK RON
Are you fucking kidding me?
How does it feel to know your last battle was one of the worst in Fresh Coast history?
I’m savage. You’re average. Your rapping’s
like trying to get a package on Sunday: you’ve got no delivery.

‘Cause you want to be top tier so bad, dog. You hardly even tough.
I swear, watching you and Mic Phenom battle
was worse than watching retarded people fuck.

You style burglar, I’m a child murderer: I kill wack kids.
How come the best line you had in that battle was a reference to Illmac’s jizz?

No matter how much bitch shit this dickless kid spits,
this linguistic misfit’ll slit his wrists quicker than breakfast grits
missing Bisquick with extra swiftness.
Listen; let’s get specific. His whole existence is fictitious.
A living wish list to be the switch-hit mistress of Kid Twist in his bitch’s lipstick.
Stick to your other interests, like kick-flips, ‘cause on the spit tip,
you’ll get dismissed by this sadistic twisted whiz kid
when I rip this infant wide open like rich kids and gifts on Christmas.

CAUSTIC
You got the oldest fill-ins. That’s no one’s feeling.
Plus, you look like Owen Wilson if a cobra bit him in the throat and killed him.

This the only Cadalack that takes keys in his ass.
The reason is that, I don’t mean speakers and amps
when I say he puts twelves in his trunk and gets beat from the back.
You look like Stevie Nicks ‘cause in the Year of the Rat
your dad bought a 1973 Grand Marquis in green and black
and you were conceived in the back.. to Fleetwood Mac.

You ain’t hard at all, sipping up forties of Armor-All with your homies from art class.
Y’all think this phony’s a hard match? Bitch, show me the Carfax.

Okay, I get it, you’re a talking car. But KITT from Night Rider rhymes tighter,
and anybody who’s ever recognized you thinks you’re Existereo’s driver.

You just can’t stop me, Ronny. There’s no way I’m getting fucked over,
not until I prove this jalopy’s just an overrated cupholder.

You had it good in L.A., Ron,
but the drugs they’ve been feeding you made you fucking inferior.
So what’s the good of owning a Cadillac if you fucked up the interior?

Let’s put all these suckas dodging Lyt in one circle.
You who I got to bite next for sho, Red.
So I brought a perfect round for this bloodsucker, O Red.

What’s popping, B? I hear you popping, B.
Well where I’m from, even stars get a round for that flag: thirteen colonies.
That’s food for thought on your plate, O(Plato). Socrates with philosophy.
Keep it going? I kick that shit: soccer cleat.
Keep it going? Any rapper I de-feat, Wu Tang, that mean I’m Wallabee.
Keep it going? Grape street, my Mobb Deep, causing Havoc, the prouder G(Prodigy).

It take one eye to see(Odyssey), even the oddest see I— you be killing me.
When you rap, the shit sound like a soliloquy.
You very’ Pat Stay: you out your cotton-picking mind thinking you whipping me.
It’s three rounds; your three stories won’t make you triller, G(trilogy).
Chicago. Y’all ready for me to kill this geek?

Say no more. Let’s rock, Davone. Hope you like Papa John’s,
‘cause tonight that’s what you eating, and I’m treating.
Bitch you hear what I’m speaking but you ain’t peeping it. Can I translate it for him?
That mean if you try angles(triangles) in your rounds you’ll get boxed;
Red rounds over the top, I’ll pepperoni your piece of(pizza).

Daylyt-vs-O-red-Red2
Hold on. Ain’t Kannon on the team you with?
Well I’m just saying, when I snapped in Chiraq he had a front seat to it.
How it’s me you get? I see the shit. Devious. Paul paid me to get Peter picked.
Ironic how your team’ll get freezing stiff when that heater lift.
Have every Grape here(hair) on lock; Wiz Khalifa shit.
That shotty have bodies looking like cheetah print.
Your team ain’t cut too solid, so when they see your caesar split, them C’s ‘a split.

Rican clip: I’ll bend day.
For the mucho dinero or pesos, fuego. Ay dos mío, I can see in Day. Comprende?
(Cortez got that.) This toon fucked. Hentai.
If Red face you here(hair), I’ll crack a(cracka) battle rapper with a Bigg K.
One through the middle of this weak(week) nigga.
Fuck up your winds, Day(Wednesday).
Got to aim six inches below the target when the shit spray.
The chopper(chop a) half of a foot off: Kunta Kinte.

I’ll bag cans for your six pack. I’m Corona Lite
with a Carol Anne clip, that mean that shit’ll go in Lyt, no Poltergeist.
I’ll take his blade, hold it tight, and stab you with your homie knife,
if you don’t jet, I(jedi), use Lyt saber, I’m Yoda nice.

Tonight, I’m a demon,
dropping thirty. This gon be rack, tree-oh, I’m making Day lie(De La), Souls is leaving.
A pair of docs you’ll be needing for the paradox of me squeezing.
Meaning if I spit a round, you’ll catch it and be sleeping.
This magazine that I got National Geographic:
headshot from the Lama for the issue. Push his beak in(beacon),

Send Lyt to the sky. I’m just trying to get a signal. Official. His life deaded.
Acting dizzy in the dome, I’ll put a bullet in Day’s(daze),
now heaven’s gate is where Lyt headed(lightheaded).

Nah, you ain’t make me mad, I’m sorry, my nigga. I just got to do you bad.
Since you Spawn and I’m dog, it’s only right that I Spaz.

You’ll get shot in front your son, king. When that burner bang,
leave a grape splattered all over his Prince. What’s that? Purple Rain.

I call this shit “kicks on fire”. That mean it’ll break a sneaker down.
December 12th, my ass. This chrome eight releasing now.

Hell Rell in the booth: that Ruga spitting.
Y’all know what that mean? If one fly, son die. His son cry. No euphemisms.
That youth ‘ll miss him.

If dis appear to Day, you gon disappear today.
I’ll turn him to a ghost, and it’s evident, I’m talking clear as Day.

I’ll give him a long sub for trying to be the hero.
Violator one, Spawny boy zero.

DAYLYT
Lately they’ve been saying my career on thin ice. I’ma show y’all Gretzky back.
I need y’all to do me one favor. Just one favor. Be completely quiet and let me rap.

This gon be one fine ass slumping. Think wine glass bumping:
let’s suppose I toast men.
Nah, I ghost them; nah, I goes in, the most in.
Shit start to get Bad, Boy,
another King getting boxed off top like they brought Los in.
Posting. I’m too creative; creative postering. I’ll be the host and
I attach to the body for growth; it’s gross but I grows the motion.
Ran, step, we coast through ocean where they host the boats and
you want to bridge, thinking my style just appeared
when I’m crystal clear like they brought Bose in.
Enough of the boasting. You decode it? I’m colder than below ten.
For those who want to B.A. Master, I’m degrees higher.
Sire. Fire as hell if I let the flow sin.
A one hundred percent perfect Day, and in that case, you get no win(d).
Lyt for the pick, see the omen. Oh, men, let’s bring some hope in.
They hoping I’m open to test O pen.
I’m going for the skunk, the monk who became Peter Punker, punk all you Uncs.
I’m where the show been; still I slow end
any career that think I ain’t a real nigga. I’m Quill, nigga. Come and provoke, then.
Think a Chinese going bankrupt: you’ll wake up with a broke Chin.
I told you, I will(wheel) have lines if they spoke pen. I go for the clear body like I won’t cloak skin.
They said, “Day, you should be careful versus the red Street Fighter.”
I reply, “all-you-can(ah-yuken) get flame.” Now let that soak in (so Ken).

Daylyt-vs-ORed-Daylyt-2
Shit like that is why I’m past these peons by eons.
Me, I’m like, wherever O be, we on Trice.

He gon say he..
Peep the line; it’s the sleepy sign. Nigga, I’m beyond(be yawn) crazy;
the best to be is my Destiny, Child. The flow beyond say(Beyonce) he;
‘bout to catch a humongous body. That hoe beyond Gracie’s.

Nigga, what the talk ‘bout in this talk bout? I don’t cop out like the police.
I took money on the house but I don’t show lease.
Look at his body gestures. His cloth probably highly polyester. Yes sir.
But I’m just up here rocking the gold fleece.
Mean guys get clean fried; I use no grease.
Pack the rhymes; never slack with lines, but let the flow crease.
Snacks aside, this cat Devone; to get the mass, never go yeast.
You took this match for a body gain, but wait(weight), you lost.
And they was all telling me O beast(obese).

You got large pounds, nigga? Die it(diet) down.
Think it’s a wedding scene how I’m wetting things.
I’m the best author. One through your chest(Chess), partner; I let it Steam(s).
The last nigga I pulled the nina out on, I told him I bet it sting.
I treat that bitch like getting a call from your side bitch
when you with your main bitch: I silence her, then let it ring.

Let’s lift the quota high for O to get the show to start.
Aw, Homie, son snapping: get a load of Bart.
It could be double the animals in one room, but I still know a(Noa) mark.
A chess pawn. They said I was just drawing; I’m showing art.
You don’t hand over the bread(Bret) brother, bullets ‘ll hit O in(Owen) heart(Hart).

Round one, I’m trying to show y’all how I don’t care.
You knew I would go for the plain(plane) body ‘cause O here(O’Haire).

Round Two
O-RED
I’m back in Chicago with a .45 for a mirror match.
That’s a double entendre; you caught it, clown?
You vers’ the iron; you from Jordan Downs? Well I’m Jordan down.
Known to burn fat. What that mean? That mean I scorch a pound.
Cannon drumming on them niggas in purple: Morris Brown.

Now he doing all of that fool clown shit but yet and still,
you be talking ‘bout sucking dick when you Twittering.
And misspelling half of your words. Sheer ignorance.
A gay battle rapper who can’t spell? I get the shit.
You a double entendre for Ill-literate. Shit.

I knew you couldn’t be straight. Your tat crooked.
Fuck around and get a hate crime charge for this ass whooping.
Body shot, jab, hook him, he drop, the strap push him.
Leave that extra shit on his lap top: I’ll Macbook him.

Ass whoopings, I Dish On Demand. Signal, and sat a Lyt(satellite).
Savage life. Farooq, Bradshaw, you’re a actor, Lyt(acolyte).

I’m havoc-like. Static, I’ll draw, blood. Flabotomy.
That mag bust, your ass fucked from what’s on the side of me, you copy me?

Shit get Jazzy Pha when the G arrive.
Produce a hit for the Ciara featuring Petey Pab.
Just to feed the squad. Even my Mrs. love it how I turn bodies to mini-pies.
I’m cut-throat: Sweeney Todd. My fleet street; this the demon side.

Now pay attention, folks, ‘cause if he cross that intersection,
in a second his inner section get intercepted.
Then flame his bitch; make his heart burn, no indigestion.
Think him in a year: when I pick the weapon, Smith and Wesson,
face shot ate(eight) Day’s off with the .357.
If you didn’t catch it, don’t even stress it. Here go the quickest lesson.
I said, “think him in a year.” So y’all tell me, how many days in a year?
365, right? So if I pick a weapon, what’s left if I ate days off? Three fifty seven.

Bang. That pipe clap, lay his homie type flat.
Body him, then I’m at Quill next(neck). Nice tat.

Shots pop like a thot giving insight to his chick.
What that mean? That mean that ratchet’ll end Lyt and(enlighten) his bitch.

I’m sick. When I write my three, my bars hits like a shotty banging.
Every word crafted for the kill; I’m speaking body language.

Your three? Two be ehhh, the other you be going dumb.
But that means you only fire one round, like a golden gun.

Y’all want to hear some trill facts? He got advantages this match.
Chiraq want to hear me snap. They’re just hoping that you rap.
You got to put on a mask to spit that crack.
How Suge say it, Surf? I’m a real goon; I wear that ski mask like a hat.

Daylyt-vs-O-Red-lyrics-Red
Nah, matter fact, fuck that. I could spit flame without the mask, nigga. I’m Scorpion.
I’ll pistol whip his ass with a ratchet. Swing that forty in.
Right(write) across(a cross) on his forehead, like I’m anointing him.
Reverse Kemp: the forty bang after it point at him.

Want to hear know funny shit?
Before he lost his way in this battle culture, all you Quill fanatics wasn’t on no fan shit.
But now he top five on y’all shit, off straight trolling and Instagram pics.
I just don’t understand it, the irony.
How a nigga with no logical progression progressing off some antics(semantics).

Off that alone, that’s why I got to slump him tonight.
Kannon told me I had him, I was up for a fight.
Turned Gandhi for forty nights: I did nothing but write(right).
Neo when he lost his sight: I see nothing but Lyt(light). And his wife.

She try saving you, the nine get to spitting.
You gon need a miracle for Davone intervention.

I’m Agent Smith. Mr. Anderson gon remember me.
When I murder his father, son, and holy spirit.
He ain’t even catch that, that’s his Trinity.

Third verse, I swear I’m going hard on your chick,
with no remorse. I’ma leave a bullet lodged in her shit.
It’s gon be like both of Trinity’s death scenes. Wanna know why?
He gon have to pull that round out her body; I’ma putting bars through that bitch.

Ya heard me? Jersey.

DAYLYT
Soon as they put me on this damn flyer they knew I’d hand fire.
A torch is what I got to show this guy.
O demise. My perception is inception: the dream is something I control.
You’ll see the four, then sky(folding sky). We hold ‘em high, then O, then sigh.
I been chasing O since ’07, now I double O seven times. Do I gotta reload the line?
Chasing O since oh-seven, double oh seven, hold ‘em high,
let ‘em go, then I(GoldenEye)

become flight Lyt, I go for the plain(plane) body, skip the departure signs.
Partner, this part’s surprise; part ya, arrow to get arch torture, we cart your lives;
I black on one in a Million, Man, but I don’t got Marching pride.
I just want confirmation for this type(-)writing.
One day they gon let a author rise(authorize). I never card decline.

Daylyt-vs-O-Red-Daylyt
I just swag hard on these bad fathers;
only other option is for you to get dead(-)beat.
You still don’t get what my M.O.s is?(Moses)
Well this the part where Red see(Red Sea).

A brother with Flubber kits: I get green out of control.
Don’t stutter shit if a brother slip.
I make B rest, feeding you this formula.
These babies gon realize I’m on some (m)other shit.

I swag flyer; cash higher; just flow, Escrow, the pad buyer.
Your man win; I get a mansion(man chin) bigger than Quagmire’s.

Wait, but let me remind y’all. These slimeballs can’t define god.
They die hard soon as the Tom call their bluff,
but I come tough as McGruff; this shit is a crime, dog.
Whether you get smoked or not, you can’t decline forward.

The blind fall soon as they call shots.
Mutumbo vs Air Bud: finger wave after dog block.
I’m all Watts. Any kid with the can get hard knocked.
All Watts. Every nigga on my team a animal: we Starfox.

But Red, this is why I’m ahead of y’all. I ain’t scared of y’all. I don’t duck. What?
Big Pun, Fat Joe: I’ll tear a squad(Terror Squad) the fuck up.

But this a case where you out(-)classed. Too much time tardy spent.
I got the job done when I have to face the higher(hire).
Soon as the coin toss for shorty, it was Harvey Dent.
They should’ve told you you would have to face the fire.

But if he play buster, we’ll do it the G way. The streets say rush ya.
Make three simple sounds and get beat crazy: DJ Mustard.

Round two, before I got hot as the Devil with this shit,
I tell all you rap niggas, it’s levels to this shit.

Round Three
O-RED
Let’s clap it up for Davone Campbell,
‘cause this the second time he ain’t bring that bullshit where the Bulls play.
Your round was actually better than the words that I thought you would say.
Wordplay, punches, schemes, you was spitting shit the hood way.
You nice, dude. Ice Cube: today was a good Day.

But at the same time, it’s a sad night. I’m past nice.
This where my bars school Day’s(School Daze), this G on your head, Half-Pint.
You ab, Lyt, when I’m addressing, you lose, wait(weight). This the craft, Lyt.
I’m trying to get you shine. Just a flash, Lyt.
Not the vast light, ‘cause I’ll expose a lot of your messy shit if I black, Lyt.

I watched you take the penmanship, style, angles, antics..
fuck, even the movements of Lux.
Small burger, lettuce, tomatoes: you’re a junior to Lux(Junior Deluxe).

When you rap, I envision Oprah and Danny Glover fucking.
Oh y’all ain’t even catch it, I said that mean when I look at you, I see Beloved.

You dressed up like a slave, my nigga. And lost to a white man on a battle rap offramp.
Then you had a second chance vers’ Iron and got your ass tore. That’s facts.

Daylyt-vs-Ored-Ored-4
That was a free head shot though.
How you dressing up like Twelve Years a Slave and couldn’t manage to put Solomon north up?

Chicago, I told Kannon, “Quit with the tough words you fuck nerd, nigga.
You make Chicago look bad: you a Yung Berg nigga.”

But this fag? He hurting all of our swag. He a butt plug nigga.
You make hip hop look bad. You a Young Thug nigga.

Choppa drop him, make him brush that canvas, that’s how I paint the pic.
Hit nothing but Lyt; from this range, I’m all Day with it.
Banana clip break your shit. I’ll lift, get to waving it,
You’ll get stretched next(necks) from the rings when I bring that K in(Kayan), bitch.
Kayan tribe, Google it; that bar was some amazing shit.
Fifty round drum that’ll turn swine to bacon bits.
That Tom knock the air out a pig(’s) skin. That’s a Patriot.

The single barrel shotgun, that shit built like a curtain rod.
Gauge, twenty shells. That mean from that 20-12, his Earth ‘ll die.
This faggot nigga at the wake, shirt and tie, front row, sure to cry.
I’ll leave Lyt’s spirit bodied if I merk her, bye. Merkaba. Google it; that bar’s certified.

That mean I’ll shoot your broad, Daylyt, in broad daylight, blaze her with the gun.
If you Play in Chicago, my shit raising(Raisin) In the Sun.

That just reminded me. You actually said you would fuck Diddy? You a motherfucking lame, mu.
A faggot who 103rd flagging, what’s that? A grape fruit.
Me aim shoot, leave his cage loose, and sent him to Jesus
with a Great Bambi-no, I’ma hit your Babe Ruth.

I’ll push her shit back like Stephen. You know, an A. Smith,
and make you leave without your bitch, you’ll Skip bae-less(Bayless).
I’m great with the glock and the pound; I could Matrix, or late switch.
Nine to five will make a Day shift. Amazing. Give me room. This Day’s end(Inn).
Think he winning? Know what’s amazing?

He came to Chicago, and stole my Big T O-beast bar.
No wonder he think he winning this.
‘Cause the nigga he mimicking, even mimicking Red rhymes.
Vers’ Charlie, Lux did that Ben Stiller shit. You know, the shit he said? Mine.
Pay attention, homo. The proof is in his logo.
But I get it. You can be Beloved Two. Just use a couple of Red lines.

This shit is gon be nasty on the net. I’m talking porn site.
‘Cause most of y’all ain’t get half of this round on-site.
It’s for the people on site.
I did this for the fans on the W.E.B. that’s loving what the boy write.
I’m Floyd-like. He’s just another nigga smoked.
Billy Gruff: it’s always a troll fucking with the goat.

I swear to god on my momma, if it wasn’t for the gwala,
I wouldn’t even bother. But y’all know what they say, right?
Another Day, another dollar.

Jersey.

DAYLYT
What I did in my third round versus Ooops, I’d like to call this the sequel.
Fact that I’ma talk about my family, and then I’ma talk to my people.

Look on the news; look what they do to our people as a whole.
I get it. The plot is not as simple, see,
them cops find the right block to plant the right rock
which keep us divided with buying entities.
Divide and conquer. But we built for that street life, riding like it was meant to be,
but I get it. They got us fucked up physically,
and then they got us fucked up mentally,

with something called cerebral fear. Example number one:
it could be six niggas at a dope house, one got a chopper, one got a rocket launcher,
one got a A.R., one got a nina, and one nigga got a tall gun.
Let one police hit the corner with one snub nose .357,
and all six of them niggas all run.

Daylyt-vs-ORed-Daylyt-point
The question is why. But if it was a black nigga, they ready to start the ruckus,
bunch of Uncle Ruckuses.
But they don’t do shit when the cops steady bothering kids.
It’s funny how all these niggas say they got beef baking(bacon),
but none of them willing to slaughter the pigs.

But I get it. You play gangster on the stage. Damn. He style thugging.
His boys with the business, too. His family wild bugging.
Make up your mind. You with the shit, or with your knot. Damn, he wild gunning.
We don’t know if you a man or a bitch: Sammy Wild 100s.

But I get it. Nobody want to do nothing, huh.
The last nigga that played King, they popped his dream.
How we gon ask for justice for Mike Brown? Justice for Trayv-
nigga, we still ain’t got justice for Rodney King.

We can play gangster all we want. But ourself is who we lying to.
We claim to be pit bulls, but to the police, we Family Guys, dog. Brian, dukes.
If any one of y’all niggas ready to go out in the streets
and war it out with the police, then I am too.
You’ll find a battle rapper marching up the street
with the can, sir(cancer). I am Ooops.

But the cops really got us so scared, like, scared than a motherfucker.
Like, every time I cut on the news I’m like, “Damn, look what these guys done done.”
I’m so afraid of the police, I could be in the middle of getting robbed,
and debate if I should call 9-1-1.

I mean, the fact is, if I’m getting robbed, the worst thing that can happen to me
is a nigga take my clothes, I fall to the ground, one of them boot a nigga,
or I could call the police, they show up,
don’t know who robbing who and just start shooting niggas.

But enough with the positive shit.

Shit been looking a little shaky. For this crowd, I came in a rattle.
Last time I was here, I had a crack rock so big, Ill tried to drag it home.
This time, I got a crack rock so big, Yung Ill came to the battle.
Google that. Google if Yung Ill was here.

Your fans say you the best ever, 'cause you dangerous with different stuff.
Your charisma is unmatched; you make the crowd wanna listen up.
You got killer angles, deadly freestyles, and your writtens tough;
that's partly why fans gave you the wins over Clips & Lux,

but I don't give a fuck. Tell me, why is he so elite?
Wait a minute. I thought this was Hollow. Y'all got me battling Tony D?
A nigga with a whole first name, but his last name is only D?
Well, I don't give a fuck, y'all getting the same Jones from me.

Eurgh, why you amp him up? I'm back, with the cannon tucked,
It's Loaded, spitting Hollow rounds like the Black Panther Lux.
Remember this?

"As far as bars, he's a poor man version of Chilla Jones' stuff.”
Well, I'm glad Shotty caught on.
It was clear from your very first battle in this artform.
Truth: that's word to the pad you copied bars on;
you been biting heads right off the bat like Ozzy Osbourne.

Tell your posse, get they mob on? Shit, it's whatever.
You ain’t a G. You soft as a Dutch sweater, with plush texture.
Just estrogen. Why your thug’s extra with tough gestures?
If it's hype(-)’r(-)tension, I'll squeeze arms and have a Blood press(-)ya.
Surgeons pulling fragments out your chest where the slug entered,
now everything coming from the heart like a love letter.

Whoever praise ya better save ya, ‘cause you ain't got a trey to blam.
Think graffiti: Tony gon get it shaking before he spray the can,
or turn bitch. That’s how you switch agenda(gender) without changing plans.
Son gon see pops in the ring like Shane McMahon.
I’ll shank your man. Watch where you aim the cam.
If his blood dry on the lens, they'll see Burgundy on the screen like Anchorman.

I know where they rank you fam. This is where your name shines;
They love you here. I don't expect cheers when it's game time,
But when they go back to their flats, and get to rewind these same lines,
Oh the irony, how you'll win at home, but, lose at home at the same time.
My frame of mind: why pick me, Tony? That choice senseless;
with 5 9s I'm Royce reckless;
I'll pistol whip everyone in your click til your boys neckless,
let it ring, then I’m coming after Tone like a voice message.

This a deathwish, My Killer Instinct is so savage, bruh.
Lyrically, I'm a Street Fighter; I scold battlers.
A Mortal (K)ombating this pen? He's no challenger.
I'm way brighter. I need a writer of Soul (C)alib(u)r,

so next year, let’s set it up. Let's get him set up for the upset.
I'll make a deal wit you: an extra buck fifty, I’ll get him cut next(cks).
I got a blade you can't stomach, money: that's a gut-check.
Sketch artist: that lead drawing ‘ll make him look suspect.

I must flex. I got a name in the States, Tony; I could ignore you.
Shotty and Soul got a name in the states, too;
look at all the work they put in for you.
After your choke vers’ Real Deal, Don't Flop is the only league booking for you.
I dont get it. Ain’t being wanted ‘posed ta(poster) have everybody looking for you?

I'm putting a whoopin on you, 'cause you battled dudes who sound like me,
but you ain't never stood in front of three rounds like these.
Bosstown.

TONY D
This weekend, they assembled the greats,
so props to the staff, 'cause fans been looking at this schedule amazed.
The calibre of battle rapper that have stepped in this place,
I’m talkin legends. And we get to face some American brays.
You man are no longer setting the pace.
You've been sleeping, and whats that taught us(tortoise), if anything, mate?
Not to split hair(hare)s, but you’re no longer ahead in the race,
and Chilla, I confess it's a shame.
Your material? Denim, on a fat bitch, it stretches at strains,
and I guess in the States, that shit connect and it’s flames,
but that’s ‘cause they backwards thinking, like a trip down memory lane.
This crowd a bit more intelligent mate,
'cause This Is England. And now the script read I skin heads
like Shane Meadows setting the stage.
King pen, this the end of your reign,
'cause off top, I’m too(two) on point with the tell(tail). Ain't that a devilish trait?
For the Hell of it, straight rob you for whatever he paid,
like, “Hands up. Now back down." Look like you trying to start a Mexican wave.

How you stepped in my face when I’m at the peak of my powers?
The plan is to rain down and rock your world: that’s a meteor shower.

Mr. Jump-to-top-tier-from-the-Proving-Ground. That's old news.
‘Cause I’m Mr. If-I-spit-three-rounds-I-don’t-lose.
You tweeted you was coming here to smoke Tone’s Boots,
but no you ain’t. And that loose Tongue will get its owner Laced;
you'll need your soul(Sole) replaced, 'cause he'll get worn out, like old shoes.
You're having second thoughts now; I know you.
Wishing he never answered the call like Colin Farrell in phone booth.
On this card he act(cardiac) like trouble, that’s a code blue.
I'll split your dome into sections for entertainment like the O2.

Photo by iDJPhotography for Don't Flop.
Photo by iDJPhotography for Don't Flop.
This cold proof you ain't Tone’s rapping equal.
No antics, no gimmicks. I’m plain old fashioned lethal.
Online, they over hype you, claim you toe tagging people,
but don’t force belief in false readings,
'cause they gas you more than they should like a Volkswagen diesel.
This is evil. What I’m performing is torture,
punches have you stumbling as he walks to his corner,
it’s hard labor, he’s left leaning, like a Corbyn supporter.
I’m sick. I’ve got a rhyming-when-I’m-talking disorder,
and i still can't swim. No, check the Deffinition, I’m still walking on water.

Wavy. I don’t sound like C(sea).
I only took this battle to steal your soundbite clean,
'cause you ain't never stood in front of three rounds like these.

Round Two
CHILLA JONES
This round, you getting fire out the gate, like hell’s entrance,
with conviction behind these bars minus the jail sentence.
Your chick, say you're a boy, and I'm a man, and that's the real difference.
You can't measure up; that's why I rule her(ruler) like twelve inches,

but, let’s use the metric system. Guess I gotta switch the plan,
Soon as I get sent to meet her(centimeter), she on her knees, unzipping pants.
You the head of the house. Well I'll kill a leader(kiloliter) when I'm clicking cans,
and if your, mums mum’s there wit’cha, I'ma hit’cha grams.

Listen fam. You tweeted he was capable of writing with Jones.
I seen ya sit us in(senior citizen) the same tier, that ain't a lie to condone.
Now I'm tight in a zone. I brought an L to leave(elderly) this old man,
‘cause he ain't know what retire meant, holmes.

But let him tell it, he aint retire. It was his career on a breather.
I came here with some ether. You prepared for a schemer.
Freddy Krueger vers’ Meek Mill: a nightmare to a Dreamer.
Grip the knife. Come get a slice like we sharing a pizza.
Ventilation how I’m airing the heater.
Or think a cabbie on a slow day, Bro: it’s no fair(fare) with the meter.

Either you should've brought your best to me, or backed out, scrap,
‘cause Eurgh done put you vers’ a steamroller. Now let's see if you can flat-out rap.

You outmatched. Y’all think he super smooth 'cause he grins a lot.
My troopers move, gripping glocks to shoot at you, them twins ‘a pop;
They sends a shot. If you came with a crew of dudes, your friends'll drop.
You survive? They switch the plot, say "Rubix cube" and spins the block.
You niggas thought 'cause of a few good battles your pens are hot?
Debatables, those are ties. We can't tell if they wins or not(windsor knot).

Photo by @iDJPhotography for Don't Flop.
Photo by @iDJPhotography for Don't Flop.
Defend your spot, 'cause Americans kill you when you begin to fight us,
You be on track, and then we stop your run.
Maybe that's why they tend to knight us(tendinitis).
You the king of writers?
If that's your goal, then(golden) touch the stage vers’ the one they think is Midas.
Y’all feeling(Filling) he got the Crown til the K(Decay) in his mouth like gingivitis,
but you supposed to be a pain in my side? Let’s let a pen decide this(appendicitis);
we both sick, but this a different virus. I spit the nicest, ripping cyphers,
I chews ‘em up, and spits 'em out. You chews(choose) nothing like you indecisive.
But y'all claim this nigga righteous, so Tony act pompous,
til he slip and inspect a(Spectre) clip like the Bond flick.
Rock him once, all fists. Knock him unconscious,
everybody turn and yell “Oh!”(turning yellow) like jaundice.

Y'all pick. How y'all want his ass to say goodnight?
Either shots sail(-)or see if he can navigate a right.
He tried to phone for help. In that case, he had to pay the price.
Whoever he call ‘a see him(coliseum) covered in blood like a gladiator fight.

Good night, ‘cause you battled dudes who sound like me,
but you ain't never stood in front of 3 rounds like these.
Bosstown.

TONY D
I've come to expose your style, make these people wake up,
'cause you work hard to force lines, like the barber that gave DNA his shape up.

This what chilla bring to a written:
“You need a genie to defeat me and fix you winning,
I’ll throw money in a hole, well, you into wishing.
I don’t feel you, and I trust my intuition.
You're gettin schooled for a fee, you in tuition.”
Then it goes way fuckin left:
“Scratch that, I’ll make your dogs flee(flea) like they’re into itching.
Point at hat, big stick make you fly, like you into witching.
We're going Hertfordshire. After the win, to Hitchin.”

It’s that, or shitty word association got him feeling himself.
So Chilla got some nonsense schemes in store like Keenan and Kel,
and some reaches as well, but that shit easy as hell,
if you ain't even going to bother to speak how its spelt.

You're pulling wool over eyes thats what your whole career is.
I sparked a Benson, started reflecting, and it hit me: you're all smoke and mirrors.

They don’t see the deceit in the lies you bring,
but the same people claiming your rhymes will win,
same people claim Fetty Wap’s the hypest thing,
'cause In the land of the blind, the one-eyed is the king.

That shit’s a crutch, it is such simple stuff you're thinking up,
makes dumb people feel really smart, but it makes smart people feel really dumb.

If you disregard spelling in real life the way you disregard it in a battle,
you'd be shit on Countdown, Ouija boards ’d be hard for you to handle,
and you'd start a bit of hassle and cause arguments at Scrabble.

For instance peeps, listen please, and you tell me, is this a reach.
You know Pocahontas? Ratatouille?
Well, he pronounced that using different speech.
He said "poker honest" and "rat the toolie”, just to fit a Disney scheme.
“Rat the toolie,” I swear, I sat there in disbelief,
like "did he really j-“ And then the crowd cheered, and I kicked the screen.

That shit is weak. We calling it a waste man method.
Chilla reach with that Jordan in SpaceJam tekkers.

You reckless, the way you take it further.
In the spirit of Johnny Cochran, no, J(O.J.), they let you get away with murder.

What I’m fearing is the battlers and fans with less experience
are really starting to take that reach shit serious,
'cause Dot follow your sentences, full stop, period.

But they’re scheming awful bars and reaching awful hard,
but I figured Black Thought will expose The Roots 'cause that’s when Things Fall Apart.

‘Cause you don’t stand up to scrutiny. You probe and find
that what you kick is air, like Bigg K reacting to an opponent’s rhyme.
I won't deny it’s funny to me that you’ve got an overbite
when your performance sucks 'cause its got no teeth like Obie Trice.
They know I’m nice, so me catching this body come as no surprise.
They fucked with me since Double P was part of Tony’s life.
I came out the hood spitting poison: that’s a cobra strike.
Now i hold my own, no fucks given: that’s a lonely night.
And you can't see me and I’m fucking up this room: that’s a poltergeist.
It’s over, time.

Round Three
CHILLA JONES
I heard you paid a London chap to scrape up dirt for you,
a VIP ticket in exchange for some made-up personals.
But them lies wont hold weight, they'll make it straight up worse for you,
and I designed every line in this round perfect for hurting you.

I heard a few things and I was taken aback from that,
so this round I’m breaking you down, no punching back to back.
Now we criticized T-Rex for being a nurse that be packin straps,
well newsflash. Turns out T-Rex isn't the only nurse in battle rap.

As Tony D, you be putting on for London, making the city happy.
As a nurse, you was putting on.. scrubs, and changing shitty nappies.

As Tony D,  you was the champ, and nobody could get rid of ya.
As a nurse, you was amped.. to take old ladies to the cinema.

Give it a rest, bruv. You the softest Tony ever. You think a G bluffing?
Tony Scarface was a thug and drug dealer that kept keys running,
Tony Soprano was a mob boss that had everyone in the streets duckin,
but Tony D, a 36 year old black nurse outta East London.

You fucking snake. Now let me expose how you double crossed.
Flex hit you for you versus Raptor. He even put Gemini on the undercard.
He told Flex, Eurgh wanted the same battle on a summer card,
but he would do it on Flex’s platform 'cause he ain't fuck with y'all.

Am I lying? Look at the reaction on this nerd’s face.
You even accepting that battle proved you're a rapper with the worst traits.
You view this as a white league. You wanted to feel blacker in the worst way,
You shoulda known it would be a Dizaster in the first place,
'cause that’s a spit in Eurgh’s face.

And in the States, you'd be an average, colo(u)red battler. That's all, that's it.
You got a little humo(u)r, some flavo(u)r, but I don't think you all that sick.
Plus the rumo(u)r is you still owe Flex a little money,
and that's who you’re trying to avoid contact with.
There's no hono(u)r in that behavio(u)r.
He paid you for labo(u)r. You decided to fall back quick.
Now this is an angle and a scheme. You probably won’t get it on the first listen,
but I said colo(u)r, humo(u)r, labo(u)r…
Anyway, in the U.S., we spell certain words different. The point is this:

Against Brits, that’s the battles that gave you clout.
But think about those words, Tony. All it takes is an American to take you(U) out.

What made you doubt I would win? This a L he’s getting.
I see death in your future; I can’t help these visions.
Long rod ‘ll make sure it’s his self he’s sticking(selfie stick);

you get the picture? My shit is sicker, and that's why you losing now,
against Mr. Jump-to-top-tier-from-the-Proving-Grounds,
Bosstown.

TONY D
So you’re from Bosstown. I was gonna do a Boston rapper scheme, Bro.
Then I realized, there’s Guru, Solar’s ex-boyfriend..
and the guy that was in Gangstarr with Premo. And Benzino.

You can tell how I step that I’m on classics.
It’s an explosive level in the building like bomb damage.
The diss pen’s fire, ‘cause this pen fire, it dispense fire,
cue(Q) flames like a Bond gadget.

I’m cookin and these bars will char-grill your arse, Chill.
It’s a flipping body, hands down, it’s all in the air like a cartwheel.
I just finished washing the blood off from my last kill,
now I brought the big guns out about to rock it for money like an arms deal.

There's skulduggery a(-)foot if I’m on my job.
They put the king vers’ I.
Well to get a(-)head, that’s your neck on the chopping block.

Theres no bones to pick with Tony’s shit. This simple precision.
You try muscling on god’s turf, well, thats a sin you(sinew) committing,

and I’m too blessed. That’s why he don’t know what to do next,
'cause his brain can't stomach the idea I ain't food yet.
We rematch, I’ll be the last man standing over two legs.

So he losing hard, and thats just bar for bar. That’s barring performance.
Chill(-)a body on ice. You’d swear I come to harvest some organs.

Now if you got that, and you caught the unifying theme in it properly,
It was like, blood.. You know what, fuck it, watch it back.
That’s how you scheme on a body.

Now if i seem to be cocky, it’s 'cause I’m properly focused.
You're getting polished off, dusted down,
swept up, I’m cleaning house, just show I can keep up with the Joneses.

Im mercenary molded. I use foresight(Forsythe) in the planning stage.
This The Day of the Jackal, and I’ve got the gall(de Gaulle) to assassinate.
I woke up just to kill like a Manchurian candidate.

So you came to the UK for whose name? Are you sane?
You must be close to nuts, 'cause i got you in the pocket. That’s loose change.

Your number’s up, bingo, and we're in front of a full house.
To see me put another kid in a box, like when its too good to pull out.

See I can read his thoughts, so I’ve got to let the people know,
he can't beat me fair and square; he swear he should’ve cheated like Keyshia Cole.
They love you in Canada, over here different treatment though
'cause whats usually Organic(k) process(ed) getting sprayed. That’s a G.M.O.

So I figured, 'cause you don’t really rap that well, I’ll stick to the plan
and (w)rap circles ‘round you til you tire like the Michelin Man.

Now this my hometown, so don’t get annoyed if you can't win,
and start hyping up, ‘cause I’m poised to just spark him
like I’m boycotting stardom.
‘Cause if I flip, then it’s Clips and Loaded, or Loaded and Clips,
‘cause I’ve got to see money hit the floor like a coin toss in Harlem.

Don't you know to take your shoes off when you come into somebody house?
“This K.O...T.D, you get knocked out, just for touching down.
My Arsenal: Caustic...his D.N.A. in Dirt bags under ground,”
Lu, you say some shit like that, if Urkel ain't leaving, it's Hurricane season,
I’m throwing you(U) in the fucking crowd. Fuck all of that dumbing down.

Who want what? One-two box cut leave Lou mopped up.
I been Kobe when the shot come;
in the shark tank, big fish. The home team in the aqua.
Rush in(Russian) and he smearin’ off(Smirnoff), little homie, it don't mean vodka;
fucking punch take Lu back like Chernobly in the hot tub.
Quit playing the killer, Lu.... you not one.

This Lu person keep it a hundred; that's higher than Lou percent.
You died before you got here, Lu; I hired the looper sent.
Talk money, it's not funny when Lu purse end.
From here on out, I'm charging Lu per cent.

Now that’s some effortless skill; he ain’t gon check me for real
the exodus will, eventually feel
like you were fucked before the credit came; this Netflix and chill.
You less than a meal.

Rap game Charlemagne, Guard ya chain.
This for every gift that Lou didn't send on Father's Day.
Look at him. He’s got my eyes. Even though you got your mama name.
Trees riding the Bentley like Scarlett Payne on Arbor Day,
then drop all of his diamonds in the road like the carpool lane.
All types of ill shit, when I pass a fire over his head
to bring an end to a couple points like Marlon Wayans.
Do.. we.. have.. a.. problem, Lu? That's all I'm saying.

Hey, shit, that's just the build up. I been trying to get the bills done.
Pick the ice up singing La Bamba, that's a Lou diamond fill up.
I'll kill him.

You cheesy. "Lu easy, and a purchase (Louisiana Purchase)
bring misery(Missouri), I owe a (Iowa)
couple ass kicks, his cans is (Kansas)
in a state he don't know da code of. (North Dakota)
And he prolly doesn't know but
the Louisiana Purchase bought Missouri, Iowa, Kansas and Dakotas,
some of ya'll thinking real slow, huh?"
No, bruh. You just been in a drag race spinnin donuts.

His lines? From different battles.
Ciph a biter, don't provide a forbidden apple and start lickin samples.

Lu, you got a "Bowflex" line? Maybe a "no flex" line?
Well then I get to slap you. What?

I'll pull your lip above your eyebrow hair.
Looking like you did a 3 year bid in the time out chair.
I'll throw Ciph downstairs.

If you scheming, it's a pyramid.
I axe you to leave, I got an actual axe and I'm actually serious.
It'd be a shocker if you had a career to fix;
one jab and his ear get clipped,
he'll have a hard time moving forward without a Walker,
he ain't Fast, but he’s Furious. Y’all hearing this?

Hey, they say, "Lou's a beast. Lou's on fire. Lou's a match for you."
Lou's a little bitch. You gon lose the fucking battle and the attitude.
Next phase, the temptation stage, boy I can snap on you.
Lu, you cannot lose all the respect I didn't have for you.

And Lou means toilet in England. Time.

LU CIPHER
First thing I thought of when I heard I was battling Madflex
is, "I'm on King of the Dot, fuck Madflex. Madflex is a faggot."
Multi syllable rapping is an irrelevant tactic, but, I'm better at that shit.
But why fight fire with fire when I ain't here for wrestling matches?
And that's some of my lighter shit.

Once they booked this, he already knew he was outmatched.
‘Cause he watched my C3 battle, seen me give C3 K's
and thought he seen 3K from Outkast.
He watched the Tru Logik battle,
and with this gift, it makes sense he'd be out (w)rapped.
After viewing me versus Tru and C(truancy),
he already knew he'd be outclassed.

So y'all think Flex is dope?
Well, he on the ground floor of ground zeroes and I'm next to blow,
so y'all should already know
that I'm on a higher level by the time I get to my second flow(flo’).
I think Flex is bull. I can't even touch my effing toes,

These stretches killing me,
so it makes sense I can't reach for defeat, I ain't got Flex ability.

Lu-Cipher-2
Da feet bars. I know that's some shit y'all ain't impressed with
but for me, y'all gon have to make exceptions.
I’m nice. This year, I've gone from rapping with my friends using flash cards
to flashing up on cards at the biggest battling events.
In my Troy battle, I used a Palamalu bar that established many trends
in 2015, but what's crazy here is I coulda covered Mad in(Madden) 2010.

Video game bars. You see, that shit happens naturally
when you battle rapping me.
I've already finished him, but I'm still beasting. That's a animality.
Everything coming out of Mad is actually average rap to me, so average actually,
that we nicknamed your studio the saddest factory(satisfactory).

Wordplay. That’s the reason I'm on this card in the first place.
It's the reason Eurgh gave me Shox the Rebel on Don't Flops's seventh birthday,
and the shit I got after Shox(aftershocks),
it ain't even natural, Dizaster, but it's gon make the earth quake.
I swear to God I'm first rate.

I’m one of the best to do it, but don't expect the rest to quote it,
'cause while I was busy catching wreck before, they slept for most it,
but the vets'll notice.
So while I'm spitting, zoom the camera in on Arsonal face and let it focus
and you'll see that Lu Cipher verses shock the Rebel like my next opponent.
Flex is hopeless.

Come on, I don't care what you want now, It's time to move on down.
Every stanza sicker than cancer, and I got two more(tumor) rounds.

Round Two
MADFLEX
It's like that, Lu? After I accepted your friend request on Facebook,
you a soldier? Now you heartless? One shoulder check, his arm split.
Storm brought you hoping that you both would get adopted.
Hue and Riley Freeman flew from Florida in darkness,
‘cause they both could ride for free inside the overhead compartment.

What you want, street violence? Sweet science?
Project Greek Island won't even hide him,
so don't push any buttons, we speed dialing.
You see him go like this? (wave and point) Means there's prolly police sirens.
I'll take a couple out like peace signing;
get stuck deep in the back of his head, I'm tryin to remind him.
Left attack-- Cheshire cat: a bitch trip and see nothing but teeth flying.

Man, fuck him. Uppercut him til he float through the air
with arms flapping staring at the bird like Koko B. Ware.
Shit, I'm rolling up like mobile repair,
then put him in the trunk so long, this motherfucker will propose to the spare.

You got me fucked up. All this yappin’, talking.
If I stand to box him, half Colossus with the option to brand with losses.
land a cross and spook so many bosses, I'm thinking my hands are haunted.
Baby J, you a bad accomplice. you just let his album drop and,
didn't say a word when the man done called it Swaggaholic?
Like, you just gonna stand and watch it? “Yeah, that's solid!"
Look, man. I did research for you, Lu! I had to knock it
just to have the thought that I'd be better off puttin my ear up to a bag of dogshit. Mad been plotting. Drag a square, you get the picture? Canvas croppin.
White boy with the punches of Dan and Caustic
but style somewhere compared the heir apparent to Pass and Locksmith.
I got this bag, it's a plan to shoplift;
fuck Lu Cipher. You don't exist if this Miyagi don't pass the chopsticks.
Wipe that look off your face or I’ll slap it off, bitch.
Your cohorts fall short short as the short shorts on Magic Johnson.
Lu was like, “Battle of the night is a cash deposit.”
Homie, what the fuck make you think I don't take your half the profits?
Pourin out the fluid the man’s embalmed in,
show up to your gravesite to
talk to Lu like pop a “Woo”(Papa Wu): Action Bronson. Laugh it off then.

Run up in your backpack, Cipher.
4 dudes, the same beating, that's a backpack cypher
Start recording the corpse on the floor and snapchat MyVerse,
texting people at your funeral like “hashtag lightwork”.
I'll see you in the third if you ain't died first.

LU CIPHER
Unseasoned fans, y’all make writing for a nigga like me wack as shit,
'cause y'all can't put two and two together;
Y’all look at basic math like its calculus.
So when I say I'm a Prodigy wreaking Havoc,
I mean, y’all don't know nothing ‘bout the shit,
so what's the point in finishing the scheme about how he look like Alchemist
when I already know what the outcome is?

I'm better at rapping, but sometimes I find it's best to be average,
so I took the chemistry joke outta my round
'cause I knew it wouldn't get a reaction.

That was a bar too. You just gotta read between the fine print,
instead of getting out of line every time that I rhyme shit.
But I get it, it’s hard to stay in your lane if you ain't got what a line meant,
so I’ma give y'all something a little easier to digest.
Hi, Flex. Didn't you say you was smoking me tonight? Are you high, Flex?
Whoever said they see this battle going either way has gotta be bi, Flex,
'cause I'll bend your body in two different places and tell you bye Flex(biflex).
Still thinking you can outmuscle me, I’m thinking, “why, Flex?”
You ain't got enough biceps and triceps to try Flex.
I'm bout to try Flex. Die, Flex.

For this guy Flex, I show no type of respect. I'm from the school of Reflect,
So whatever he taught to me, I got to reflect.
You gonna throw shots? Well, they gon bounce off of me, Flex.
I got way too much D, Flex(deflects),
but this hammer? It ain't for your knee, Flex, I ain't tryna check ya reflex.

What, y’all tired of these Flex bars?
It’s cool, I got Mad Magazines for Mad Men. Y’all gon be making a mad dash;
if Mad flex, I'ma hit Madflex with mad Macs(Mad Max).
You mad trash. Glad bags the only place for Mad tracks.
Original controller in this game. I ain't playing with these Mad Catz.

Telling you, y’all gon get exactly what you was asking for.
If you had your money on Mad, I bet you mad now if you wasn't mad before,
‘cause I can take the bull, and grab the horns.
When opportunity knocking, man, of course
I'ma open him up, 'cause Mad a door(matador).

I'm from where the glocks dumping on the block,
and you dumb if you think that the cops coming,
they not. You not from it , it’s obvious; stop fronting.
Good night. You had a good fight but your box coming.
Hood type: the same type of Thug Life that Pac stomached.

And every time I step inside the booth I weaponize the truth
Cop a shirt; they fifteen a pop, twenty-five for two.

Round Three
MADFLEX
Some of y’all thought I was play pimping. Nay, bitches, I'm all heart.
Lu got the swagger of Paul Blart,
and Flex out here shitting on a tall card with all bars.
Do me a favor. Tell Marvin when the mission to mars starts
cause my patience running just a little thinner than his arms are.
Looking like Arsenio Hallmark.
Little man, I take the Crown with me like I lifted a squad car.
You the width of a pop tart.
A battle? This a victory lap through a Memorial: I'm Lynch in the golf cart,

Young Wal-Mart! I hear that eating clocks is time consuming,
I get it. But what the fuck a sheep gon do with a lion moving?
Come get it. These tards been theme park cause they ride with you, but
I get your back, I’ll get your back leaking out spinal fluid.
Flex designing proof you a stepping stone like the Mayan Ruins.
Silent movements send you skyward cruising;
I will lift you up so high, you can see whatever sign the moon’s in
and cop a squat on the the spot on the flyer that Diz and Gjonaj are using.
Lucifer headline in the afterlife, and Mad provide the height improvement.

Madflex-1
My influence?  E-40, Biggie, L and Ice Cube.
Lu rap really well… but like really well for a white dude,
it’s, like, different, know what I’m saying?
Organik, I don't care how many weirdos you call.
They keep saying the same shit when I take one down
like ninety nine bottles of beer on the wall.

For real. You don't know the drill: a Step Brother bunkbed.
Been around crime like caution tape and Bloodshed.
Now Me/Cipher: Street Fighter, cease fire, and I'm Balrog in the subtext,
‘cause even when I kick it, shit just turns into a slugfest, and this bum next.
Now you rep Waystid Talent, (Lu makes hand sign)
and that's the first time in his life that he's thrown hands in a club yet.
Don't get upset.

For show and tell, I brought this bag. Coco Chanel.
It's beasting vers’ a bee sting, and these things don't go so well,
‘cause Lu is in the loop, but I AM the loop; I hold the belt.

Asshole. Roll and sell any ample cash flow;
the show goes on, when Lu pay(Lupe), it still ends in a Fiasco.

This man is more ComiCon than octagon.
Do not yell or a Molotov cocktail hit the top shelf of ya Dodge Stealth.
Palmin a Corona, lime and fold-up under a palm up in Corona.
They call him Roswell:
his disc dropped and the populous don't know nothing. But no fronting.

Both of us been battling worse shit,
to the point where it don't matter rehearsing.
But the point is that you still don't test Flex vers’ the average person.
Slam and search em. Come back and ask if this trash is worth it,
nah, ‘cause you can't even muster up half of the version of my clash with Urban.
Back with purpose, Still ain't scratched the surface of active service.
This control, I change the whole scene quicker than channel surfing
when I lift his facial skin like a plastic surgeon.
They hand you a magic bullet , you had a shot, the plan was perfect,
Mad just curved it. Pack this nerd’s shit.
I'm taking Lu's career as a souvenir and you right the fuck back to worthless,
and I went first ’cause your third is some shit I ain’t concerned with.

Flex.

LU CIPHER
There's an infrared beam that sits on the top of every pistol I got,
so I guess in more than one way this a battle with the King of the Dot.
Flex, you wanted your chance to shine with the best?
Well, that's until I give him a shot,
and since this bum got the card bored,
well, now you can live in this box.

You'll be in the dirt, bagged.
DNA ‘ll be everywhere; they'll be calling you Dan,
‘cause sticking him up with a big K ain't a part of the plan.
That goes to any nigga on the card that want to go to war with the craft;
I got a frag grenade to put a tag on Coma toes if he walk in my path.
Reverse Live? Meet reverse lived; I’ll torture ya ass.
You holding guns, but you only got only one; I’ll let an arsenal pass.

Lu-Cipher-1
Somebody tell Flex he's filler.
Y'all need to put me in the ring with a Ness Lee, Chilla,
so I can really disrespect these killers.
I got enough pent up rage in my pen to slay seven Days,
so bring on the next weak(week) nigga.
Oh, it gets deep. This nigga Lu is in beast mode.
It's like I knew the cheat code to the human genome
So even if I go 75%, QP, even you’d you'd get 3-0’d.

I know it's hard to understand what I'm speaking if you don't have any season,
but 3 O's is 75% of a QP, mathematically speaking.

Yo Lush, I thought I was going to London next month.
So why am I battling a(-)broad?
I ain't Jonny Storm, but I got a deadman added to this card.

They talking in my head.
I’m just trying to listen to the right voices through the white noises.
Before I snap and bring an end to your name with five nines just like Royce’s.
My point is there's no way that you fucking up my voyage.
One look at you and I can tell you ain't comfortable with your life choices,

I mean, look at you. I mean, examine the type of shit that this pussy on;
what kinda nigga got a mohawk,
but you ain’t never seen him without a hat and a hoodie on?

I mean I could be wrong, but does that make any perfect sense?
That's like a nigga with full body tattoos
that you never see without a long sleeve turtleneck.

The weight of the city rocking on my back; that shit is big as a boulder.
With enough rep to carry the body too; tell this bitch I'm a soldier.
I trained for this - you gotta pay for this bit of exposure.
For thinking it's free to lay(Frito-Lay) on my back,
well I got a chip on my shoulder.

Yo, the only reason I really came out here
was to fuck some California bitches,
smoke some good weed, get some good vibes,
and rap about shooting 4k's while Avacado get my good side.

Waystid.You see all this shit right here? You’re welcome.
Consider this a early Christmas present,
‘cause it’s a gift you even (w)rapping in my presence(presents).
You been caption every second, got to at me every mention,
just been asking for attention.
You worried if I’ma bail, B? Well this a jail fee, I’m ‘bout to tax you every sentence.

Now that I’m getting paid here(hair), bitch, I weaved that battle.
And I don’t need this battle to get you Smacked with an extension.
I should’ve docked her pay, but they told me be patient with MyVerse.
Well I don’t got a ghostwriter. The fuck I look like waiting on my verse?

They say you diverse. That’s no Biggie. You Ready to Die, Verse?
‘Cause my verse, even Eminem couldn’t Stan(d). That’s suicide, Verse.
How my verse’ll leave you exposed after it Boom,
you would think I gave Tsu a side verse.
Your shit is filler. What’s in my hand Quentin Miller; don’t make me write, Verse.
Wait, out of all the rappers you know, though, top five dead or alive,
you picked Jadakiss? Well that’s a Why, Verse,
but thinking you out of this world?
Mama stop it, after I give Jo(h)nny Rockets, it’s you and I(U-N-I), Verse.

Slip up, ‘cause when I put a tho(ugh)t in a box, it ain’t a suggestion.
Where does this forty go? Rhetorical. The answer request chins.

I let a couple get at ‘em(Adam) then Eve-n they rib buckle.
One word and the pop gon ground you; this kid trouble.
But if the money official, my ratchet wig on stage: Ms. Hustle.
Six ring back to back for the green; I’m Bill Russell.

I know y’all like, “Leave homes alone.” Like I encountered Fit
to encounter a counterfeit. Man, you niggas got me furious.
You could bet the bank on it that every stock’s in Bon(d),
so why would I take a D verse if I(diversify) took the money serious?

Y’all know I only Kill for the Bills. So if you be a trick’s kid, oh, I steal daughters.
You wouldn’t have to punch your way out this box; I kill smarter.
A pie may(Pai Mei) show you I’m nothing but a snake;
come dance with a real mamba.
My pimp hand’s sharp; I will scar her.
I cut bitches for talking out the side of their face: Bill’s father.

I ain’t gotta imagine this shit, bitch. You got to imagine a line.
I be rushing to get out of bars. You be rushing to get your bars out;
y’all see how different we be battling time?
Your man’s cap could fly in the crowd over half of a line.
Don’t get your own (Charron) slapped; that won’t have your character Shine.

Just be the hippie Orlando bitch that you are. Don’t rap about shit that you not ‘bout.
‘Cause if you don’t think I’ma bully you,
I’m too big for a mid to school, play tough and get knocked out.
When the nine approaching, it’s get ate up or clocked out.
‘Cause the tool spray like it’s school grades or her boobs may:
A cup ‘ll(couple) drop out.

I already told you I’m on some other shit. I could’ve raised you, bitch.
Groundbreaker to housekeeper the way I made(maid) you, bitch.
If it wasn’t for me, you’d still be battling free, so thank me, bitch.
Nah, don’t even thank me. Fuck you. Pay me, bitch.

MYVERSE
What up bitch? You trash, but I’m glad to see you made it,
even though you almost a year late.
I told Mister Wansel this battle won’t Pop unless the deal straight.
She rob and leech(Robin Leach), trying to get her bills paid,
so since you dine and dash, let your head get the steel(steal) plate.
You ain’t a shark in this; I’m trying to kill greats,

and I’d rather drop science instead of math in this chapter,
but the mass have a factor, in this fact of matter.
You’re more known for giving that face than Jaz the Rapper.

I’m Queen of the Ring. Holly or Ali. Someone tell Bonnie I’m rawly.
Catch her all happy and jolly, blasted on mollies,
sneak her(sneaker) then check her like a pair of Huaraches.

She rides shotty with her mommy beside her,
I’ll cock, squeeze, make her knock knees and body the driver,
leave Bonnie Godiva’s body to divers.
Your situation looking Rocky through the Eye of the Tiger.
I’m a big dog. Rottweiler with a collie beside her.
She a average joe: sloppy, slide her(slider).
Ask snobby, I’ll smack the saliva.
Weave bobby pins out your tracks just to show how I style her.

This battle was only a solid, ‘cause this what the fans favor.
It may be on your agenda, but you can’t date her,
‘cause if the wood fill her,
you saw dust(sawdust), those walls crushed like sandpaper.

MyVerse-vs.-Bonnie-3
You tatted a slanted dick between your banana tits. That’s just tacky, B.
She steady juggling sacks with seeds, and I ain’t talking bags of weed.

When she walks, y’all don’t hear galloping? Kentucky Derby running laps, looping?
Just ‘cause you wear horse hair won’t make you a Black Beauty.

Those synthetics have overran their courses.
She yelled to Math, “I’m ‘bout to pull my hair out.” He said, “hold your horses.”

But even without a guy’s help,
with all that weave, you’ll still always be Bonnie and Clydesdale.

Won’t let her roots grow, but in Bon’s eye(bansai) that treatment is the norm.
I could strand my killings on your hair, but that’s beating a dead horse.

‘Cause if it wasn’t for me, bitch, you’d still be battling for free on Smack.
You have a stage today ‘cause I let you speak when I asked.
You thought your stomp would leave me starving? I’m still eating, in fact.
You keep giving us leftover bars, well that’s gon lead me to scrap.
No poetry for a reason to snap.

This work from my hand ‘ll give you a permanent band
since you want to twerk for the cam.
My bloodline bred martyrs. Taught ownership, not to work for the man,
so I became Panama’s legendary puncher: Roberto Duran.

Your family’s Jamaican, right?
So that immigration line for Ms. Fit was a mis-fit. Check your angle then.
‘Cause if we roger that, her American Dad left no name for him,
plus your tranny uncle is the gender-confused alien.

Back in Jamaica, they call a fag “anti man”.
So that batty boy became your auntie, man.

In this game, if it’s any console, we’ll just name it “Aunt-le”,
‘cause we know that’s a chick with a dick,
even if you “Look at the Flick of the Wrist.”

But I got this new dance, it’s called hitting this bitch.
This is the stage that only matters. Why face?
Titles, I snatch, fast as Pai Mei.
You couldn’t try Florida if you had the Tri-State.
I’m putting Godiva in a box; that’s Valentine’s Day.

Round Two
BONNIE GODIVA
You said you could freestyle better than me. Well guess what I got tonight.
‘Cause you just said a Pai Mei bar; this is bad business.
‘Cause all y’all do is trade marks that Copy write.

Back to freestyling. I see you brought a legend. He making crazy waves.
Well if I aim the lead, both of y’all be dancing with Crazy Legs.

I can’t help I’m sick. My whole life I never had aides(AIDS) rapping.
I don’t do shit the Eazy way.
I’m from a state where you can die when you land,
get D.O.A.’ed at your E.T.A.
You ever see my niggas courtside on the bench?
That’s courtside at the NBA.
But see your niggas courtside on the bench,
they court siding with the D.E.A.

So why should I believe the bullpen of verse or remember Verse
when she said she tried to bail me out,
but didn’t mail me out a phone call, letter, or even a pen from Verse?
Bitch, I felt like Fifty in that cell all alone. Like why raise her(razor)?
If when I was in the pen’, a verse brought me sane,
so now you getting chalked the same,
‘cause the walls where I’ma pen a verse.
Lord forgive me; I’m ‘bout to re-pen(repent) a verse,

Bonnie-Godiva-vs-MyVerse
let’s go to church.
It’s a holy ghost,
‘cause I’ll be clapping and stomping soon as they quote a verse.
My method is(methodist) to get your fellow shipped and open, Verse.
Let me work, ‘cause by the third round, Clips vers’ Lux:
first the preaching, then you’ll be piecing together a broken verse.

I don’t rehearse, and yet I’m still acquiring half of they bank,
‘cause the first one’s to fall into sin be the first ones to judge,
like soon as they see a ladder they(Latter-day) saints.

So let’s get to confession,
‘cause you be acting like Jo(h)nny Cash could get you Grammy songs.
Or ‘cause you in the Tribe Called Quest, you Queen Latifah when the cameras on.
Well, men lie and women lie, but the truth is in the camera phone.
Four years ago, you was fucking another battle rapper,
in his t-shirt with no panties on?

You talking all this battle rap shit, but you was fucking Madd Illz?
Bitch, Madd Illz? I’m mad. Ew.

But you remember them Grind Times. You must’ve had a ill disease,
‘cause you gave Ill the V to battle Ill V,
but no matter which ill you be, you ain’t ill as me.

You nothing but a Grind Time groupie that’s limelight choosie;
but why pick a old biter over a big dog? Bitch, this ain’t the Twilight movie.

She like, “So? At least he took me on a tour of the South.”
Bitch, please. You couldn’t even get a tour of his house.
He room and board her, Total Slaughter;
I wonder if he touched her core(Cor’) on that couch.
But I figured you’d let my trey pound now,
since you used to niggas dogging you out.

It that why she don’t want to profess her(Professor) X?
She was just on his team. Bitch why your Jeans gone?
I guess that make him Cyclops:
he seeing fire in a bird, but put another Mystique on.
‘Cause the way she blew(blue) skin off niggas,
she don’t even feel comfortable in complete form.
That’s why she had to switch up characters to see Storm.

You got the whorest of ways. Rihanna falling on stage: this hoe tripping.
It seems you weren’t cut from my cloth; we so(sew) different.
I got drive, Progressive, commercial;
you just ride for insurance. Our flow’s different.
Talking about sheetrock, right? You nothing but dry walls for fun,
guys, the mold different.

I mean, how the fuck did you even get here?
Norbes, you took her to the roof? You ain’t hesitate to jump off, did you?
Another rookie mistake,
thinking you gon hit main stage just ‘cause he let one(-)off in you.
But since you do get a(-)round, it’s only right I let one off in you.

I told you, I could’ve raised you, bitch.
Housebreaker to groundkeeper how I made you, bitch.
If it wasn’t for me, you’d still be battling free, so thank me, bitch.
Nah, don’t thank me. Fuck you. Pay me, bitch.

MYVERSE
*Freestyle*
First off, I’m here today ‘cause of blood, sweat, and tiers; I earned it.
But I know about three rappers that fucked you and can confirm it.

So your little premeditated bars, that shit’s not working.
How the fuck you freestyling so good,
but in Milwaukee you kept pausing? You should’ve been saying Jersey.
*End freestyle*

But wait, ladies and gentleman. Sexual Chocolate. Sexual Chocolate.
We need a axe now, really, to start chopping this fable.
You said your last match on URL was on the spot,
freestyle, what you brought to the table, right?

You ain’t atomic off the top. That’s a diss missile(dismissal).
I seen the signal when you picked the bitch that looked just like O’fficial.

And your pre-style against QP was ass; you mooned everyone that caught view.
No shade, but it must’ve burned the way that Son blocked you.

As a true emcee, that’s a low blow.
Shit was a knockoff. Say it ain’t so, hoe(SoHo).
Y’all just getting those “ether bars” from that other card she no-showed.

You couldn’t even sway Sway. You cut off 40 like you was gon spit that flame,
but was so out the pocket, they gave her change.
Sway had to explain, “it’s okay.”
They stopped the track. “She battle raps, this wasn’t your lane.”

Babs got you on Shade 45 to spit it live. Probably her biggest regret of all.
Bonnie bombed that cypher so bad, y’all would’ve thought Flex was on.

Lying(lion), trying to run, but you gon live with this Scar.
DJs wouldn’t slip your disc if you got hit with their car.

Plus, you say you draw, but that’s all sketchy.
Your definition of sexy is slutty, flat-out, it’s not edgy.
You may live in a stable, but your spot’s shaky;
you not ready. Offer me a stage, I’m making sure to Rocksteady.

I’ll admit, you were on a come-up.
At one point, you thought people were ducking you.
It’s not ‘cause you were good, bitch, just sounds like there’s a duck in you.

Can’t even think for herself. Just a thot trying to claim.
It’s like, no skills, all facade for the fame.
Yeah, it was Gladiator School, but we were not entertained.

You a weakling in this region; I seen it from the bleachers.
So I got in the game to teach ‘em how to beast it.
You lack leadership and genius.
You’re the Cyborg of battle rap: a cheater with a penis.

Remember when QP wrote for you? I know it’s hard to say,
but everything in the dark comes to light, ask Charlemagne.

QP used to haggle her for that wholesale,
‘cause when that hoe sale didn’t charge the same,
she got the Math and had to bargain for bars to gain, what a shame.

I mean, holy ghostwriters, but hey, there’s always Born again.
Let me take you to church. Born getting washed for his sins.
It was what the four told (foretold) to smite the gins
Cause I'm here speaking my verse but your lips reciting him(hymn).

Have you looking at her shake, like your last gimmick.
I’m catching this body tight, but she need her ass lifted,
especially when them butt pads missing.

I bet 40 ain’t seen you write one rap lyric. Bold face.
You wear shit with no circulation, thinking it’s gravy with all that flabby meat.
Y’all bugging if you think Bon that petite(bon appetit).

I’m here for the scolding.
You trying to rap about doing a rap, ‘cause you got your tat in holding,
but got out real quick. What’s the reason?
Felt lonely behind bars, I guess it was cuffing season.

I’m saying a game of spades is the only time you ever had a bid.
It’s like a jail riot they way they gas your pen.
You gon say I’m Latina, need a Visa, but you’re the one scamming them.

Oh yeah, and your wig fucked up. Thought I’d leave that hair relaxing? Ew.
I bet the back of your neck is scabbing. Bitch need to switch your perm.
She went from Math to multiple partners;
the prime number of STD sums, one thing’s for sure:
say goodbye to your dick. Buy that shit a urn,
‘cause Bon? Bon(bong) go smoke your bud’s pipe, watch her switch a(swisher) burn.

My presence(presents) has them playing swear to god:
guess that’s a gift and a curse.
You trying to sell them on fake dirt like that’s a pitch that’ll work.
But you couldn’t finish a sixteen, so how the fuck you gon finish a Verse?

Round Three
BONNIE GODIVA
You keep talking about that shit in Milwaukee,
but it was ten people in that room. So in other words, they all vic.
Far as bars, check my rap sheet. Crime pays, and you know it’s easy to con vics.

So what, you want to talk about Born?
I told you, this battle I’m having a open verse,
but keep talking about Born and my last battle,
I might have flashbacks and start choking Verse.

I ain’t even want this to be you, though.
Since I found out you like battle rappers, I was kinda hoping you’d like me.
And whoever told you white men can’t jump never met Mike P.
I mean, I know you like to spit. I could give you the Mike(mic) free.
But wait, maybe I should Do the Right Thing,
so let me finish icing this Spanish bitch on cam like Spike Lee.

She really think she the most def poet,’cause she be taking Q tips,
and spitting knowledge for the crowd reaction.
Well say one thing to me about The Roots,
and you won’t even be conscious rapping.

Bonnie-vs.-Myverse-battle
I get the melanin to push her melon in;
when I black, history. You don’t got the memories.
You just salty you ain’t hot this season.
Well call cajun(caucasian) if you ain’t got the recipe.
‘Cause your Net flicks(x) shows you need to stay in class,
all that Breaking Bad, you just ain’t got the chemistry.
Fuck a knife or a weapon; my mind is inception. I break towers mentally,

so while you new-slaving, I’m deuce-deuce waving,
and I don’t want to hear shit about the Zulu Nation.
Or bitch, see, Toots, see, you could be the next one who two facing.

Wait, she ain’t even get that.
Let me show you how a con go(Congo) harder.
I said Zulu, Tootsie, Hutu… that mean when I slap every tribe out her,
even Afrika Bambaataa ‘ll rewind her(Rwanda) slaughter.

Murk me? How, bitch? You ain’t even worth the while.
I’ll smack this bitch on the bathroom floor; now she Verse-a-tile.

‘Cause I’m mad y’all even think Verse is better,
‘cause she circle-stepping, blurting metas and nervous gestures,
desperate for a card again(cardigan)
so all these nerds could sweat her(sweater),

so now, I got to Prep for Redemption.
‘Cause if these bars don’t Chill(-)a nigga, I got the perfect setup.
When it’s showtime, you either getting Clips or Hollows.
I’m trying to figure out which Verbs are better.

The fact you think you
naturally have to rap like Dizaster’s a fucking disease.
She like, “he got baaas.” That’s ‘cause he be fucking the sheep.
I can tell by your ex(X)-men that you don’t want to fuck with a Beast.

So one red flag, I’m at her door(matador) for trying to run with that bull.
I don’t duck bitches. I muzzle they beaks.

This jackrabbit rhymes like a crack habit smack addict;
she really want to be a heroine.
She yelling “fuck the presidents,” but really fuck the presidents;
you bitches love to be in Maryland(Marilyn).
This beatboxing, breakdance hip—
bitch, you don’t even want to be your heritage.
Trying to make a better life thus far by getting stripes off stars?
Aw, you really want to be American.

Well where they discover you land is where this could get settled then.
‘Cause one April shower and I May flower the land you settle in.
But if the Nina Pint-her, she’ll pray to Santa Maria; let that settle in.
That mean you getting scalped in the end(Indian),
‘cause what I peel grim(pilgrim), that’s what a settle meant(settlement).

MYVERSE
*Freestyle*
Yo, that’s so funny, you brought your Mike boo, right?
I don’t care what your lines do.
It’s funny, ‘cause ironic you always have a ghost behind you.
(Earlier. You had to be here.)
*End freestyle*

Since you said you top five off of looks alone,
bet I’ll give your top five off of looks alone.
Bonnie ‘ll top five off of looks alone.
You could tell your twat wide off of looks alone.

She figured, Drake loves strippers, so she became one by delusion,
and hopes he move in
and touch her arm and say, “you don’t have to do this.”

You have the nerve to judge Germ Free when you’re worse, B.

You show your bare ass, just for a name.
You’ve literally put everything but your vag on display.
You’re one selfie away from catching AIDS.
She’s in danger, it’s safe to say,
‘cause I could put the four-five to your shoulder,
but if a thirty-eight bust, see your waist in thirty-six days.

Eight teens got hip to the stench of Bonnie rotting(Rotten).
I’ll let the five and nine find you head to toe altered with no options.
Whole time in mind I measured your body for the coffin.

I may not speak it, but I was taught how to aim one.
To tell you the truth, I’d rather make your face up.
Show your jaw the bottom of a barrel; remind you where you came from.

But where you going is beneath and below the floor bed;
you were jerking off in Milwaukee with Vixen.
Really choking; this chicken got bodied by Norbes ex.

‘Cause when you did that, you stepped in some shit, puto.
Want to talk about people choking people, but you though,
in that battle with Uno.

Let me punt(pun) it correct:
if he kicked it last, you would’ve been rebuttal’d to death.

Crazy ‘cause after the battle she gave him dome for the win;
I guess that’s the second time Uno got pussy after choking a bitch.

As a personal vengeance and as a woman, too, I was rooting for you.
We were all rooting for you.

But instead of thinking the whole time, “Damn, what Bonnie on,”
I was thinking, “Damn, Bon, neon?”

My fashion statements welcomed. Your fashion states men will cum,
‘cause if it’s fake angles only, well that’s a lack of creativity shown,
but it’s evident, Bonnie. You’re a hoe.

I got that Erykah Badu pussy; you got that airing out a room pussy.

May be a eye candy, thinking it’s the sweetest,
but like mama said on Halloween, if this (w)rapper’s open, don’t eat it.

You’re a ventriloquist and your clitoris is the color of licorice,
and if you licked her ish then you licked her itch and that’s sick as shit.

So I’ll address her call.
I’m from East Orlando, but I could show you the West Palm.
Goons run up with you saying your name; word is, bond.
Word is, Bon used to fuck John John Da Don,
almost had a baby named Bon Bon Da Don.

This angle for you is signature; she forged her vows. Her initial man opt,
she was just a chicken scratch once she got John hand cock(Hancock).

Here is where the chain connects, where she flaked the best:
you ducked me in April ‘cause you fucked half of the main event.

You vexed, huh?
How ‘bout after Math made you a step-ma he told you to step, Ma,
had a baby with the next broad,

couldn’t take you up, even said you were a lazy fuck.
See how that real ‘ll stretch her?
Or how you had to take twenty blowjobs to support Bill Collector?

I can’t even point out with all fingers who’s your damn lover.
Just habits from her elders she learned to act under.
Your real pops is your dad’s brother,
and you share fucking club clothes with your grandmother.

I was a fan of her, ’til she was stamped an impostor quick.
I’m battling her ghosts ‘cause her writers can’t top my shit.
I summon those skeletons in your closet hid,
‘cause even though I Used To Love H.E.R.,
the resurrection of her was Common Sense.

Shh, quiet down, y’all hear that? I can hear his heart beating.
B-boom, b-b-ba-boom, boom. The champ is here. (x 4)
And Magic? You’re not as lyrical, so please.
You’re fuckin round with a threat, that’s a venereal disease.

Jeez. I should be crowned the best.
They say “keep it rap”; I’ll rap. And wrap both hands ‘round his neck.

You look like you got a venereal disease fuckin round with threats.
I should Smack DVD (the V.D.) out like URL wasn’t founded yet.
Nigga this is ‘bout respect. So please address the crowd and flex,
and get killed after getting out of pocket like Malcolm X.

Get your hands out my p— nigga you heard what I said.
You must’ve slipped, fell, and bumped your motherfucking head.

He dead. Instead I’ll put two in your noggin,
exposing Black Thought, that’s how I get to the Root of the problem.

You request love (?uestlove)? Off of what? Your bars not hard enough.
I’ll have him missing in the Mil(meal) like the drive-thru fucked my order up.

He often punch. But a Danja haymaker maker make a Kamehameha quake.
Face to face, state the date. October Zone (October’s Own); you ain’t facing Drake.
Soon as Black drop the first hit, they gon boo ‘im (boom) like an 808.

It’s safe to say I been god lately.
And I don’t like you, B(QB). Don lady. But I’ll still air it out like Tom Brady.
And don’t use Born to try play me, ‘cause that battle with Born old,
and that B ain’t for Benjamin, but in (Button) here, you gon die, baby.

Crazy. ‘Cause a nigga claiming he not crazy, on a mission, more than gifted,
Incredible with the Hawk, I (Hawkeye)
never seen Black with those (Widow), nor a ‘venger.
With Iron? Man, low key (Loki) he wouldn’t lift a hammer with Thor’s assistance.

I slaughter niggas, and you nothing like Carter. Write harder.
Thinking Danja wack, I’ll bring the fade to Black like Wesley Snipes barber.

I’m your father, ‘cause to D(custody), hearing Magic why I smile in court.
The way I write, BM,
the pen dent(dependent) on the paper and I don’t need y’all(child) support.

With seven days prep, he dying horribly in the sport.
Got out the pen a week ago for what I do today: that’s a Minority Report.

Nigga, and everything I wrote is dope. I’ll rope-a-dope, then comatose ya,
The can, it’a(Canada) shoot to where the pack(Pat) stay like Nova Scotia.
Used to shit and straight flush nobodies til they fold in poker.
On cards for John Dough, it be common names on them like Coca-Colas.
Get capped for the crown; I’ll be done broke his molars.
I made a nigga throw in the towel, you ain’t mafia like cosa nostra.

Poser. I be knocking them off.
Trying to test the waters, you done hopped in with Jaws.
Nigga my style hostile and hotter than yours.
Last nigga laid down the towel(tile); you ‘bout to be remodeling floors.

B MAGIC
Danja Zone, is it? Well you about to step in that.
I put a new flame to your Breezy like Gimme That.
What’s in it will(wheel) come out of the can like Fix-a-Flat.
Bumping Wu-Tang; she met the Cal before RZA rapped.
Fix your face. Coming through my hood, better fix your hat.
You must be kidding(kitten), nigga you pussy and I’ma kill a cat,
I’ll pull out a small handgun, that’ll peel his cap,
but that bitch sound BIGger than Guerilla Black, it’s a wrap.

Nigga that Slick talking won’t make you Bond.
You stuck behind bars; question is, can you take the time?
I’ll spray the nine, put this lame in his spine,
think of Michelle Pfeiffer ‘cause this bitch Danger is mines(Dangerous Minds).

Danja gay ass a fan. He Dylan if Writers Bloque was Making The Band.
I’ll scream what I mean ‘bout something stay in the can.
What, you ain’t catch it? You know: Oscar stay in the can.

Let’s turn it up. Don’t think that you’re driving down easy street.
Sneaker-creep. Catch him at work, proceed to beat the geek.
This weak emcee get drug over the counter like CVC.
Jerry coming with something sicker than Eazy E.
What, you ain’t catch it? Jerry Heller, Eazy E?
You know the block is hot, you ain’t gotta hear it from Weezy, we see it’s beef.
And this nigga Danja gon see the heat;
I’m ahead of you, god, I’ll send yo ass to Jesus, peace(piece).

Aight Dane, change of plans.
Hook shot, then get to booting wherever Danja lands.
Talk; don’t raise your hand. Eleven milli on the killings,
and you Vince Carter: you only been on your Grizzly for a minute.

Listen. You gon die today. Boy that Cal’ll wave.
I’ll take your dime and cut her(diamond cutter), I’m Dallas Page.
That bitch’ll be on the Shaft like Isaac Hayes.
Think of Ghost Rider from the fire brain.

Your talk as cheap as your outfit. I’m ‘bout this.
All you can do is piss me off ‘cause you ain’t ‘bout shit.
Who vouch this? When I’m airing the pistol,
just hope your own head make it back to Maryland with you.

Round Two
DANJA ZONE
Shit, y’all ready for the second round? ‘Cause the first ‘bout killed him.
Then he came with that shit? Apologize. See ‘cause now you done hurt my feelings.

Now after this, hope it’s no love lost,
‘cause see, this might get me cut from my circle. It’s like a buzzsaw.
But you know the name, homie,
it’s Danja Zone ‘gainst James Toney, let’s take the gloves off.

Now when Magic get in a fight, he be like, “give me what you got, son,”
then turned Denzel in Training Day, should’ve seen what he gotten one,
not ‘cause he got wet like Ethan, how the cop done,
but J.Fox was like, “get me the bitch”; Magic was reaching for the Shotgun.

But I want to ask you something though.
Why he ain’t help you? Ain’t you two cripping?
Why you ain’t light up J.Fox like an Amazing Spider-Man 2 villain?

But you ain’t Bad. Beat It. Putting hands on a kid may be in your plans,
but why you ain’t Michael J. Fox? Oh I get it, ‘cause you too shaky with the hands.

But you got One More Chance. To retreat. Which really seems useless.
I’ll make a nigga look Ashanti over a Biggie beat foolish.
You full of false hope. This is pure dope.
To be Frank, I blew(Blue) Magic out; I’m really Team Lucas.
We share your bitch; I’m thinking he’s stupid.
Treat her *as if* she’s best friends with the D(Dee), but he’s Clueless.

Her mouth get all cock; her jaws lock. Tell your whore get some help.
The key to unlocking it is to turn on a knock; she might open some doors for herself.

You do this more for the wealth, but it’s minuscule; get ridiculed.
Dog food, that’s Beneful, you been a fool. Look at what I did to June.
I’m cold, but you know what you should’ve invested in instead of him?
Rent Em Spoons! Rent Em Spoons!

But we gon rob him. After though, John, I read my fine print.
For all that battle money, then we better not find shit.
Ask him, “where it at,” but remain calm and
wave arms if you talk slow, Magic, like a jedi mind trick.

You in a war with a warrior, nigga; can you dig it?
This is my house; you’re just lucky I let you visit.
Was death your mission? To get what you’re searching for,
see me first: I’m more of a YouTube ad that won’t let you skip it.

Could’ve battled anywhere: on the block, your cartel, wherever.
Could’ve got schooled in the IV league; I ain’t no Yale professor.
Concealed with silencers; won’t see or hear, them shots go Helen Keller.
Catch a shell over the chicken; that’s a KFC and Taco Bell together.

(And you just lost the second, nigga. Off with his fuckin head.)

B MAGIC
You super-lyrical ass rapper, you need to quit today.
Cut him short; I struck this nigga out when I pitched a K.
It’s okay, lift and, hey, Duck Hunt: pistol play.
It’s whatever. Put these two fours together, we’ll get him ate(eight).

Nah, give him one four, G(4G); that’ll take half of Zone.
Spread the word, I’m going Gettysburg when I battle Zone.

I shatter bones, with black or chrome, leave no breathing.
See, I’ma ask you man to man, where is Zone defense?

I’m sick with it; your men and them get the Thunder.
Revolver spinning, what’s in it I’m sending into your stomach.
Adrenaline get to pumping, the Smith-and ‘ll get to dumping.
Toys ‘ll get to talking like Indian In the Cupboard.

Take notes: why you wack, I’ma give them reasons,
‘cause when you rap, all we see is Slim Jesus.

And that’s your big weakness when you rhyme, Homes.
Throw him in the Eastern Pacific; you got the time, Zone?

Zone time to go ’n die. You even sigh wrong,
I’ll pull out what I’m speaking on like a iPhone.
I’ll pull what I’m speaking on; think of Jadakiss,
‘cause everything you spitting is in question, like the Why song.

Go ‘head with the sneaking,
don’t make me go with the .44; if you give me a reason,
I’ll take the clip out the .22, man, your head’ll be leaking.
I won’t stop with the Emmett til(Till) you dead from a beating.

This nigga sweeter than a milk dud;
fuck him. I’ll put holes(hoes) in him like a strip club.
You big scrub. You seen what I did to Lynx, cuz?
This rapper dead, nigga, R.I.P. to Chinx Drugz.

I’m so deadly; I’m cocking the chrome Desi,
then go nuts on the side of your face like Loe Pesci.

What. I’m so deadly. I’m headed to see you.
I’m walking dead up on a nigga, bitch, my Resident Evil.

Your talk as cheap as your outfit. I’m ‘bout this.
All you can do is piss me off ‘cause you ain’t ‘bout shit.
Who vouch this? When I’m airing the pistol,
just hope your own head make it back to Maryland with you.

Round Three
DANJA ZONE
This is what advancing up a tier look like.
Keep looking, ‘cause this is also how Battler of the Year look, right?

Right. This a nigga ‘gainst enigma. I’ll murder, slay, slump him.
My win(d)s up. Death, I’ll give this cat a gory one(category 1) like a hurricane coming.

Fuck him. We’ll storm in like really bad weather,
with niggas that’d split your shit off the strength of a simple hand gesture.
With semis and hecklers, on the outside waiting to nail son like Winnie Mandela.
When mill’s(windmills) make him glide, that’s Wilkins and Drexler.
Ricochet when it spray off you with the tan sweater,
then you, then the kid off the wall like he Willie Manchester.

You good; I’m just a tad better. Seek Jesus help.
Lucky Ill ain’t keep clean and good health or else you’d be on the shelf.
From the weigh-in, there’s no way in hell this crip(crypt-) keeping the belt.
What could you tell me for this L, B? What’s on that skeleton that speaks for itself?

Give him heat til he melt. Grab the nine and pop niggas.
First Day, then Danny, now you? I’m even sending shots at my niggas.
That was fuego. Despite who I may know,
I let that milli rock on any block(Bloque) nigga.

Speaking of Bloque niggas? We may be friends,
but they gon speak on this battle with Jerry Douglas, and Danja then
say J.D. lost that bitch like Janet left Jermaine again.

Damn it, I came to win, and he’s still waiting on magician bars.
Magic under the illusion his shit is hard, which is odd.
Pick a card, any card. I got a casket for you,
how you saw the box and(/in) have(/half) the gall with this facade?
Now I gotta disappear and act like fuck it, after I get him gone,
if he pulled a rabbit out his hat it’s still no way he would’ve won(wand).
Buy why lie(voila)?

I’d be got tier if this shit was about classics.
Be real, this shit ain’t ‘bout skill, it’s ‘bout status.
You had Danja, rocking tie without slacking,
and skill got killed by MD like malpractice.

What round did you win?
I’m punching your lights out, you don’t even know the round that you’re in.

But I’m off that. You just a floor mat at The Format,
so before you even mention a nigga, say “Where your bars at?”

B MAGIC
This is where you rest in peace;
a motherfucker can die from these bars, and you next to see.
Get your Cake up, bitch, I’ll hit your chest(Chess) with Steams.
Too many counting on your pen; we need a referee.
You ever seen Harlem Nights? Well bet a G
that I won’t fight a nigga quick like Della Reese.
And whoever’s sleeping on me can get the heat;
that’ll wake up everybody like Teddy P.

Tell him we outside, posted up with the heavy glocks.
Cut a nigga throat, then drag him bleeding for seven blocks.
Hit this nigga ten times, but he was gone by the second shot.
I hit him from the blind side like Fetty Wap.

What, you ain’t catch it? Well I ain’t gonna repeat the shit.
Planet of the Apes: this monkey gon get his Caesar hit.
Arms out when I ride past like he need a lift.
You’ll get thirty out the rocket: that’s Kenny Smith.

That’s old school; king Magic come to claim the throne.
Don’t worry walking through this so-called danger zone.
Banging chrome with the fifth on my waist;
this rapper get send to god on a mission with Mase.

All right, stop it with the tough act. Okay Danja, fuck that.
I throw bullets down in(end) Zone ’til it touchback.
How you feel that you’re getting killed with the rough draft?
Slug him, and slug him in the same spot where the slug at.

Hold up. Let me roll up. This pound hold ‘bout forty shots.
Nigga, a freezer won’t the reason this forty pop.
Big strap. This is 50. Hit him from forty blocks,
or get the Thrill of(Thriller) getting knocked down with this 40 Glocc.

Yo, this nigga gon see stars,
getting whipped for a couple of bands like cheap cars.
Next nigga don’t give me my space gon see Mars.
You got a xanny flow: you put niggas to sleep with these bars.

Your flow as cheap as your outfit. I’m ‘bout this.
All you can do is piss me off ‘cause you ain’t ‘bout shit.
Who vouched this? When I’m airing the pistol,
just hope your own head make it back to Maryland with you.

I told ‘em once: these motherfuckers scared,
I’m from the motherfucking Lou, that’s how a motherfucker play it.
Beat me? Can you believe what this motherfucker said?
You must have slipped, fell, and bumped your motherfucking head.I prepared for a three round battle. Last minute he switched up.

Came dressed like a burglar fiending for money, but he bitched up.

Now you got the crowd down and out.

I mean you’re just gonna go in one big circle, so what’s this one round(-)about?

Ever since Calicoe punked him in the States, he ain’t battled since.

You’ve been a unhappy camper: mad intense(in tents).


www.idjphotography.com
Matter fact, ‘fore I get to this battle rap, let me show y’all what type of cat is Pat.

See? All his big ass'll do is tap you back.

Can I finish my round, or you want to stand up here and go tap for tap?

I mean ‘cause don’t look at the host like nobody‘ll probably stand down,

there’s no Organik. I’m not Charron.

Come to the stage and stop Hollow’s hand (Hollohan) now.

So we already got you punking Charron and Cal punking you.

With that indication, now it’s telling me depending on the pigmentation,

you’ll switch your statements.

With Sketch Menace it’s, “Shut up! Don’t Interrupt me, I’ll kick your face in,”

then it’s, “Hey, Head I.C.E. Your shit’s amazing.”

See I always mention Head Ice ‘cause it’s the Jim Crow law.

They think the darker you are, the harder you are,

or the lighter you are, the lighter you are, and that’s not right.

I give everybody the same respect, but if I have to fight,

I treat a scrap like Mike: I go pop, It Don’t Matter If You’re Black or White.

You’re not a Canada thug. To a street American, you’re a average battling punk

that only gets paid from YouTube, so you add(ad) on the front.

Ooh, I hope you get AIDS and Alzheimer’s,

so you can forget you got AIDS ’til all your exes start dying.

I hope you crash into a median, car flying.

Eighteen wheeler almost hit you but <screech> park by you,

he think he safe, ’til sparks ignited from a small wire,

it explode and he die in a car fire.

Nah, minus the all-timers, I’ll four-five him.

Bigger the body, the bigger the hole size is. We just keep digging like coal miners.

Speaking of coal, I got the coldest flow, cold for sure, four below,

colder than Nova Scotia snow, colder than my heart which is frozen though.

Cold enough to let the toaster go at his grandparents’ mobile home,

Grandma do the rope-a-dope, Grandpa do the okie doke.


www.idjphotography.com
Enough of the jokey jokes. They came for your funeral.

It’s a million ways to die, and I want you to choose a few.

When I was young, I was a heat blower: revolvers with speed loaders.

Now it’s a drum and a Tommy gun, look like I’m swinging a leaf blower.

Or, I could’ve got him slaughtered at the border,

by an East African kid that I sponsored for a quarter.

Or, my nigga’s suicidal. He tripping ‘cause he homeless.

I give him the word, he’ll take him with him for a bonus.

Or, my niggas from the seven give him seven for seven pounds.

They bring them guns.

They say “Pat Stay want to play the god? Well tell the King dem come.”

Nah. I said he’s just an informer. So you should Snow what I’ma do with that,

I’m Sizzla mixed with Jigga, Supernat mixed with Super Cat.

I get the vibes(Vybz) from my Kartel, then like Mavado, us two'll Clash.

Then I’m back, moving packs through them bags, stacking Buju bands.

I hold that ting. I load that ting, then reload that ting.

Do this all natural, this my old man ting.

This a cold man ting, this a cold man ting.

Flow so cold, you should snow that ting.

You should snow dat ting, you should snow dat ting.

<Skrrrt> like Reeks when I blow dat ting,

when I blow dat ting, when I blow dat ting.

Pat, didn’t you cross your best friend to amp a crowd for a battle style?

Well you Skip to My Lou, the way you crossed him, then passed him, wow.

Wait, I could add a And-1 ‘cause that was foul;

he Skip to My Lou the way he crossed him,

then went behind his back just to rap a round(wraparound).

Now I got something that I owe Pat. So I’ll give him something old, <pat>.

The steel erase ‘is thoughts(racist thoughts) like the old Pat.

Then I circle around him like a news chopper. With that new choppa.

Big enough to knock down Chewbacca. I’ll Tupac ya then ask Who Shot Ya?

Throw your body over my shoulder: boombox ya.

Steel toe boots on, I’ll moonwalk ya.

Trying to play Jedi mind tricks to Luke ‘walker.

Eminem said you couldn’t sneak a plastic gun through customs,

and he’s right, y’all. So fuck all these gun bars.

Let’s get into these knife bars. I hold it with a steady right,

then get his chest very sliced with a chef Curry knife.

Or a ox pick ‘ll drop his spleen and he’ll need doctor treatment,

got a minute to live, he trying to Google how to stop the bleeding.

Get it down. Rex, keep my name out your mouth and you could get it now.

I’ll spit a round and— ooh, you lucky it ain’t a second round.

PAT STAY
Scraight to it, no time to waste. Fuck you, right away.

Fuck you, your gecko eyes and I’m-about-to-start-crying face.

Fuck you, your whiny, Siamese-cat-dying,

Mommy-my-knee’s-scraped, lord-why-me, help-please-untie-me,

I-scream-with-the-dry-heaves-at-a-high-C-five-weeks-straight,

I-need-bass voice, fuck you.

A woman’s fingers jammed in a car door. Other hand in a lawnmower.

Iggy Azalea on tour. Nails on a chalkboard.

A foghorn. Hardcore dog porn.

Just a list of things I like hearing a lot more. Fuck you.

You said in the world I’m number sixty-four?

Then tell them, why the fuck ‘d you pick me for?

What you never thought I’d catch onto it? He set up all of this.

It’s in England, that’s why he picked me over Shotty, it’s obvious.

Battle of the Brave, more like a coward who’s afraid,

respect to Shotty, but I already bodied him,

now you just dug a hole for yourself for me to dump your body in;

body on top of body, I’m on some Giant Gonzalez shit.

Man what you gonna do? Give me some business tips

and educate me like you did with Clips?

Like, “all you have is ClipsTV,” like he got bigger fish.

Dropping all that knowledge, I had to go and look into it.

And dude might actually be onto something, he’s on some different shit.

Innovative genius; he did his research for real.

He got a website now, and t-shirts for sale.

You got hoodies too, bro? Look at you go.


www.idjphotography.com
Whoa. Don’t forget us little guys when you blow.

Dog, you got Loyalty Ova Money custom-made pens?

Shit, they aught to give you a chair on Dragon’s Den.

He’s like, “god, I’m a innovator. Fuck a job or a business major.”

Mum calls him a minute later like, “why is there an intercom in my generator?”

I got to ask you a question, my brother. From one entrepreneur to another,

how did you come up with making shirts in different colors?

Like, just to be a fly on the wall. What next is he gonna discover?

He’ll watch a porn like, “this guy ain’t even a real plumber.”

But wait. Man, what you know about business ethics?

And listen, it’s ‘bout to get interesting.

And I’ll run it back ‘case it gets intercepted and you didn’t catch it.

You gave Drake the Started From the Bottom beat.

Your boy Mike Zombie made it, but you’re the one who shopped it, see,

now, that’s where royalties and publishing occurs.

Stuff just to ensure you get the cut that you deserve.

Mister businessman here ain’t get nothing in return;

his boy Zombie got cha-ching and fuckin chucked him to the curb.

This motherfucking nerve. Talk about my ten grand.

(Oh he’s right here? Yeah?)

He’s right here? Cool, well off the head, man,

he’s just creeping up to you like some type of obsessed fan.

He’s right the fuck there? This dude’s still your friend? Damn.

If that was me, Zombie would be a walking dead man.

Hate it or love it, the underdog’s on top, and this sucka’s getting mopped.

But he was scared to have it judged

so it’s technically just a tie whether he wins or(Windsor) (k)not.

But this is for y’all: for all the TV series they stole, right?

Fuck this American. A Canadian’s stealing the show tonight.

Hollow the Don. What’s your mother’s name, Donna the Mom?

You got a face that says, “I don’t understand how this condom goes on.”

I can’t tell if you look like a salamander or a tropical frog.

Did you catch a flight here or just fucking hop off a log?

Hollow the Don. I’m a big fan of all of your songs.

That’s bullshit. Sound like you’re fucking dropping a bomb.

Hollow the Don. How ‘bout a good old game of follow the palm?

I’ll put a hole in him, leave Hollow all empty ‘cause he ain’t solid at all.

Go to his funeral service; they ask me to turn my volume off,

I’ll fuckin jack that shit up on blast, set the ringtone to Atomic Dog.

No respect. See his casket, I’ll <spit> right on the box.

And that’s the best case, like an Otterbox.

Leave smiling. Cold as February.

Got a strap and I’ll cold buck it(bucket) like Ben ’n Jerry’s.

And I been just dying to bang it like the secretary.

And it stay in my jeans(genes) like it’s hereditary.

I’ll hit the cemetery where your best friend was buried

and steal the red rose from his headstone and replace it with a dead canary.

Disrespect on a whole different level;

rip the stems like a producer sending the engineer an instrumental.To keep it real with y’all, I could beat Bigg K in just one verse.

So I’ll be on a roll after I tear him to shreds;

I’m fuckin Lush One’s shirt.

They said don’t sleep on your opponent. That fool K legit.

He’s got haymakers and bars; man that dude say some shit.

Y’all hear him in the preview talking greazy?

Like he just gonna soufflé the kid,

man I haven’t heard you that hyped about a trailer

since you got a new place to live.

But his fans talk about him like he the best kept secret,

like it’s blasphemous; he’s somebody that I could never compete with.

He’s top five, next to... Cyborg Eminem and Redneck Jesus;

Bigg K’s such a fucking thug even his name is on some extra G shit.

But honestly bro, I hate how simple you write.

It’s just a bunch of metaphors, similes and likes,

man, motherfucking cats like you get the fuckin idiots hype,

but you an innocent type. We live a different life,

I mean your delivery’s tight, but dog, you are Deliverance white.

I mean, ten years ago, you wasn’t getting down with the bitches.

Looks like you used to paint your face and get down with the sickness.

He said he’s got Walmart lines; well that would explained this discounted image.

But you can’t fuck with my brand: this Target ‘ll put Big(g) K out of business.

You are the worst kind of white. That’s why your lines are not good.

This shit’s like South Park: no one understands when Kenny tries to talk hood.

Two years ago, you used to call us all nerds, but I guess he rock with us now,

but if he says a line that don’t get reaction,

then it’s something wrong with the crowd.

You like to talk while people rapping. Oh my god, you’re a clown.

I’ll put a pistol in his mouth. Let’s see him talk through my rounds.

B2B3 Caustic vs. Bigg K
Bitch, I’ll be stalking your house. While you sleeping all alone.
Feel the steel against your dome while you’re reaching for the phone.

He said I got a geek squad. But ain’t no trouble(-)shooting people in your home.

You don’t know my history, dog. I’m incognito with the Chrome.

(He doesn’t even fucking get it, that’s how fucking stupid he is.)

He thinks he’s Nino with the blow, so he deserves what he’s getting.

Shit, you wasn’t locked down for that long, dog, I heard you was snitching.

Oh look at him shaking his head, like you wasn’t a fucking nerd up in prison.

I bet you get checked on sight(site) like terms and conditions.

Dog, people talk like you’re the best, but you are honestly the worst.

Why don’t you go spit some more Digimon bars and then call us all nerds?

So keep this shit rap, and do not talk through my verse,

before I have to make a split decision

about which chin I’m gonna fuckin sock you in first.

BIGG K
Hey yo Caustic. Your nose look like a guitar pick.

Nah, it look like your pops is half swordfish.

My shit rip through bricks and make floor rip,

this a match you ain’t fit for; you should forfeit.

Four-four bulldog or the four-fifth.

Money’ll get a magazine: that’s the Forbes list.

You dead. I’m picking up a box: that’s a forklift.

You softer than Norbes fist; I’m strong as a horse kick.

B2B3 Caustic vs. Bigg K
You rely on personals and disrespect.

‘Cause if you was to just spit, we’ll feel a disconnect.

I rap. You a comedian. Hit your set.

You just a funny, low-life piece of shit, at best.

You gon need Arcane to come and write your verse.

Remember when Soul duffed you? I’ll do you twice as worse.

Rip your throat open; put this knife to work.

The doc’s gon have to button around your neck like life alert.

Big Berettas. The kickbacks ain’t get-togethers.

Twin M-9’s, look like you trying to knit a sweater.

If he bugging, I get to spraying: that’s the citronella.

And one pump can split a pumpkin like Cinderella.

It’s gray hairs in your beard; you should get some gel-a.

You rocking the Salt-N-Pepa like Spinderella.

Bang. While you rip the leaf off a ciga-rella,

you’ll catch a bullet in the teeth like Penn and Teller.

So say my gun bars is fake. Question my thug affiliation.

I went to prison for armed robbery and assault with a firearm;

that’s public information.

But I’m ‘posed to believe he evil and got a gun in the briefcase,

‘cause he scream when he rapping and put on the mean face?

Look man, you walked in a loser. I get the win on arrival.

Jesus Christ, K the god, I go across your shit with a bible.

You gon realize you ain’t fit for survival

once you get the chance to spit with your idol,

and this is a big ass G check like Illmac winning the title.

Now open with a rebuttal. Bring some clown to the vibe.

Dickride the Bay Area to keep the crowd on your side.

But y’all put up a Warhol against a fucking cornball.

You had the whole time I was rapping to think of four bars. Go ahead.

Round Two
CAUSTIC
It’s exactly what I expected: bunch of death threats that didn’t mean a thing at all.

I guess the story goes,

if you’ve seen one Bigg K verse, then I guess you’ve seen ‘em all.

I’ll make a deal with all of y’all.

If he can go the next round without saying the word “like”, I will retire from rap.

He thinks he’s Dr. fucking Dre, it’s all “like” this and “like” that.

But you didn’t sound like that in ’09. Shit you didn’t rhyme like that.

Not when you was begging me for battles back in GrindTimeChat.

Shit, I know this guy like that. Me and dude got a history.

I opened doors for this bitch, I guess you could call it chivalry.

I’m trash? Bitch, you trash. You gotta be kidding me.

Whoever dropped you off at the event should’ve got a ticket for littering.

All he talk about is video games and cartoons,

and y’all swear like his bars are the hardest,

but it’s honestly kinda what I expected from someone I legit thought was retarded.

And I swear to fucking god, if this fat piece of shit keeps calling me garbage,

I’ll put sweepers on his helmet like he’s Marvin the Martian.

I said fuck his size, I’m this high, I’ll kill his style with two bars.

Said even we inside, let’s fist fight til your left eye is f.u.b.a.r.

Oh now your lips dry, can’t spit rhymes, get this guy a cue card.

See you can’t do what I do but I’m pretty sure I’m better at your style than you are.

So what you wanna do, dog? This your funeral, K.

You’re a big fat nervous nail-biting motherfucker; how them cuticles taste?

Dog, y’all really think K’s a gangster with a tool in his waist,

but I’m a real estate agent: you make a move, and I’ll put you in your place.

I keep my cash in a shoebox. No revenue’s in the banks.

I don’t care if money gets locked up, then this dude isn’t safe.

You a counterfeit. A little light behind him will prove that he’s fake,

and y’all can count on me to keep it one hundred until I’m blue in the face.

Yo he does a little thing every time that I rhyme;

I dunno if I’m battling somebody or fucking fighting a fucking mime.

Yeah, I’ma keep it one hundred with y’all.

Anybody this fucking big should not be a coward.

Dog, I don’t know if I’m trying to battle rap somebody

or fucking argue with the bouncer.

Dog, he claims to be a boss that spits fire, but his punches don’t got any power,

so it makes a lot of sense that you and Illmac looked like Mario versus Bowser.

Honestly, I fell asleep through half of your rounds.

I mean if you keep stepping up, I’ma keep backing him down.

But I’m back now, the man they’ve been asking about,

I say fuck Illmaculate, I should be the champion now.

B2B3 Caustic vs. Bigg K
Shut the fuck up. As if you had any doubt.

Dog, if he the man of the house, then I’m grabbing his spouse,

put a gag in her mouth and fucking dragging her out.

I’ll yoke that bitch up while her panties are down

and slide a dick in her ass while I’m tapping her out.

See I’m the dude that live the shit that you be rapping about.

See I don’t normally rap but I had to make an example out of the clown,

look at him, nervous. You can see the sweat damping his brow,

somebody pass him a towel

like Th3 Saga when he’s logging onto his Brazzers account.

It’s in god’s hands now, bitch, what them passwords about?

BIGG K
When we first met, he said, “Fam, you nice, K.”

And I appreciate that, you fake ass Andrew Dice Clay.

Look, straight to the money once I land: two-night stay.

I will pop you cold square in the mouth like a brand new ice tray.

Razor to your face, get severed in cold cuts.

You soft. Peanut butter and jelly with no crust.

A two-piece, then you ‘sleep. I can tell he’a fold up.

Do something. I will smack the gel out your bowl cut.

I grind the whole winter, through the cold and fleece;

I’m blowing sticky like a hippie, holding the piece(peace).

You think you fast as lightning, toe to toe with a beast,

just ‘cause you got a haircut like Travolta in Grease.

What you know about grinding and ducking raids when the feds sweep?

You blow that big ass nose with a bed sheet.

Bigg-K-vs-Caustic-recap
They threw your ass in a shark tank; you dead meat.

You’ll be your homies’ chest piece by the next week.

I talk it ‘cause I live it; you don’t live it to talk it.

Hit the compartment, click it, then I click it and spark it.

Two eights, roommates: they’ll split your apartment.

Enter the gauntlet. This the strongest shit on the market.

This idiot Caustic lost it. He ain’t no type thug.

Get a bright idea, I will break your light bulb.

Make this Italian speak Spanish before I take your life, blood,

‘cause you gon give this floor a kiss, in Beso Nightclub.

Skip the babbling. Before rap, I was in the Radisson.

O.T. with my O.G., really trafficking.

Breaking down, bagging up, clipping, packaging,

and wasn’t stepping up in your spot ‘less I get the ratchet in,

so stick to battling. I hit harder than fifty javelins.

I took Caustic in the Bay ‘cause I’m into traveling.

You need the hometown support; I ain’t really mad at ‘im.

I bring that fire shit to your porch: Billy Madison.

Round Three
CAUSTIC
I am sick and fucking tired of them saying Bigg K talks that real shit.

So I think it’s high time I pulled your card, you giant fucking Garbage Pail Kid.

Y’all heard him in the trailer hating. Saying that my angles is a crutch.

But you’re basically saying that you’re not creative enough

to find a specific way to say that I suck.

I mean, you could say the same, but you playing gangster too much,

so here’s a fucking angle for you, K, you tell me if I’m making it up.

So me and you got cool around when you lost -- and I lost --,

so please believe that I meant that shit when I called us homies.

It’s hard me to stand up here and even call him phony.

But what the sad part is is that my own boys really do not know me.

I lost my dad when I was five. I lost my brother when I was eight.

I lost a couple homies this year, I just had to shoulder the weight.

I don’t even blink no more, dog, this shit happens every day,

but y’all keep trying to make this battle rap shit real.

Man, this battle rap shit is my escape.

Man, it’s because all you fucking battle cats are fake.

Acting like you don’t got an emotional side.

Honestly dog,

I think about my dead homies every morning the second I open my eyes.

So if I ever fucking push you away or act different then don’t be surprised;

I do it for your own good, K, ‘cause everybody close to me dies.

I remember back in the day when I didn’t have any rights.

In and out of group homes and jail for over half of my life.

Before I was taking this battle rap shit to new heights

I was taking baby steps because my shackles was too tight.

So nowadays everybody acts like it’s cool to be a criminal with wealth.

But every time you rap I just hear a bunch of bars about you snitching on yourself.

Dog, a lot of people know me from outside of this shit.

Including you, K. And you know I don’t like to glorify the type of lifestyle that I live,

I mean I never did this shit to be cool. I was just trying to provide for my kid,

‘cause if he needed it

I would honestly give him the lung straight from inside of my ribs.

But this guy. This guy. Man this guy isn’t it.

You serve dime bags and shit. You don’t understand breaking pies into zips

and trying to add just the right amount of cut to maximize what you get.

Dog, you don’t know that feeling when the five-o pulls up alongside of your whip,

and he’s giving you the eye because you’re higher than shit,

hiding your sweat ‘cause you’re three deep in the deep East

and you got a trunk with a disconnected Alpine full of bricks.

And you think your little fucking rap lines gonna hit?

There’s nothing you can say to me.

I will let you walk a mile in my shoes just so you’re a mile a-fuckin-way from me.

So for those that don’t know me, this some shit you’ve never heard before.

I keep that part of my life separate because I prefer to work alone.

You try to dig your little dirt but I am cleaner than a germaphobe,

and you about to get so much work I should’ve hit you from my burner phone.

I’ve met all my heroes. And they all say I’m the dude.

You just write a bunch of shit you saw in movies and you fake like it’s true.

I didn’t bring you all the way to San Jose just so I could play-fight with you,

this ain’t no viral pity party like fuckin Daylyt and Oops.

So I bet you sound real cool to them little kids that never struggled,

but I just wanted to reminded you what you sound like

to those of us that really hustle.

BIGG K
Daniel take your pick: revolver or a slice,

I got the hammer and the pick, like I’m carving out of ice.

See I could bar you to death, but that’ll hardly be a fight,

so I’ma use this third round to talk about your life.

You brought me to your house. Say that isn’t facts.

You got a grown man roommate. Just two dudes, kicking back.

That don’t mean they licking sacks, that ain’t what I’m getting at,

but they got a fucking kitty cat. Dog, what type of shit is that?

But I guess when you’re Mr. Disrespect, that’s how you do things.

Walk around Oakland with a cat on a shoestring.

Got the nerve to talk crazy and be kicking that wild shit.

Knowing that your living room smell like Meow Mix.

You kiss that cat in the mouth, and put it in your purse.

Before you allowed to eat, you gotta make his dinner first.

You on Twitter popping off like you gon get at Surf.

You feeling Evil ‘cause you pen a verse stroking Mr. Bigglesworth.

I will Petey Pablo that little shit, it stinks.

Skin it alive and sew a fucking midget mink.

You in the house overflowing your kitchen sink,

struggling trying to give a bath to Mister Jinx.

How you a stray pet back tickler but yet he raps sinister?

You tried to trace a day in my steps, you’d snap fibulae.

Fuck these racist fans that say we rap similar;

I bark with the big dogs. You a cat whisperer.

It pisses in your bed. Made you buy an extra sheet.

It purrs on your chest while you cry yourself to sleep.

You’s a motherfucking girl. You done made your choice,

and you battle ‘cause it’s the only time you get to raise your voice.

So stop lying like you mean. You fronting, that isn’t facts.

Ain’t hustling in the rap or running in with a strap.

Next time y’all hear Caustic thugging up in his raps,

just picture him and his roommate on the couch, cuddled up with a cat.New York I'm back, fresh off of bodying Prep, did y'all miss me?

I heard Danny get punch drunk in bar fights, leavin niggas all tipsy.

So I'm supposed to be scared to let the BarGod get me?

Well, call me the BarDevil.

‘Cause what I say tend(Satan) to hit and you'll loose if a(Lucifer) bar miss me.

This what gets me. He aiight. Good bars, nice performance.

But y'all amp em like a champion. Y’all treat him like he Michael Jordan.

Well I'ma put you in this plain(plane) black box, like a flight recording;

Ay, ARP…I hope this nigga got life insurance.

‘Cause tonight we warring. I don't care if it's a gat by ya,

I'll aim the nine, flame his spine: that's when it back-fired.

He'll hit the ground, then I'll stand over that clown like "I did you bad, Myers",

And be the nigga he looking up to, since I’m who he ad-mires.

Now if there was a billboard, for overhyped battlers, you would be in that ad, Myers,

You said you punch in 90% of your bars… but use 2 bar setups, hmm…

Can you add, Myers?

Well I'ma bag Myers. Homie sound pathetic on wax,

I'll run up in his studio, you could bet that I'm strapped,

Open the door to the booth and throw lead in your back,

Now that's my way, of stopping a nigga dead in his tracks.

Matter fact, I gotta right(write) for you. Come and get this hook from me.

Sidenote: you look ugly.

And how you never got paid for these battles you book, dummy?

Now trust me, I'm good money.

Homie you Shang Tsung: tryna be the sole(soul) owner of a style you took from me,

this crook funny.

He brought the D.A. to(2) NY, so I waited ’til his ride came thru,

jumped in the V, and made ‘em C K’s between his two I's,

and left shells beside they shoes,

now two bars ago, I spelled his fuckin name out…

and you know it, ‘cause you got the mind frame to,

but what you probably didn’t notice is in the bar after that,

I spelled your wife’s name too.

This what I do. The burner hold rounds like a Discmaker.

Get Black buried over games like it’s Brick Breaker.

You got me in my old Zone, that's big Danja.

Machete chop em at the watch; I’m a wrist-taker.

They mistake this kid for a mad scientist,

Dr. Jekyll, with a split personality but I Hyde the shit.

You pussy. Open this vagina lips you’ll find a clit.

This is light, but seeing son die’ll(sundial) show niggas what time it is.

And why insist I got my style from a son, nigga? Jones is smart.

I ain’t falling for that stunt, so how niggas figure I’m Owen Hart?

I came to set this bitch on fire, like Joan of Ark.

On the poll he in (Napoleon) the lead,

but I’m breaking every bone apart (Bonaparte).

I know I'm sharp. On a one to ten scale I'm a fuckin million,

I’m something brilliant. Battle rap's Russell Wilson,

but not ‘cause I'm destined to be a legend after big moves to come,

but ‘cause even though I see errors(Ciara’s) in my present,

I’ll be fathering the Future, son.

Now shoot your gun. It’s lights out if I blow the flame.

A shot in your mouth’ll numb your jaw like novocaine.

In Phoenix, you told Chaz you brought that “Ch” to “AZ”.

Well I shouldn’t have to load and aim and let that toaster bang

to show you my “Ch” illa, you know the name.

I control the game. So you might’ve battled dudes who sound like me,

But you ain’t never stood in front of three rounds like these. Bosstown.

DANNY MYERS
I was reading an article about you, it said Chilla Jones top pen.

And I can't even tell you the rest, 'cause I stopped then.

I mock men, “screep” up on him 'cause his people wildin' out,

then plug in the back of his head like Neo dialing out.

Him beating me? Nigga keep dreaming. You just gon keep scheming.

Before there was Scheme Street, me and my niggas was in the streets scheming.

Streets fiending to see two beast demons’ damn writing.

We lock horns like rams fighting. I'm fast enough to can lightning.

I should let the hands strike em, open palm like I'm slap boxing.

This is when Bruce Lee was fighting Chuck Norris with the cat watching.

Rap’s his profession; I had to invest in a Crack option.

Seven shots in rapid succession from a black Dotson.

Chilla be pointing niggas out in the crowd: he Matlock-ing.

He better make sure he lock his Holmes, I’m a black Watson.

I swear, I'm from where there were no necks they spared.

The night was illuminated by the tecs they flared.

Ironically, due to lack of male(mail) in the house,

niggas had to grow up overnight or get next day aired.

Chilla’s a snitch, real shit, so when I cock it, he's a corpse.

I don’t care if I’m with my kids and he's spotted from the porch.

Those coke sales were plotted from my thoughts.

How I get that Benz? He know, (Benzino), Boston cops got it from the Source.

You’re getting your career stretched; you ain't nowhere near vet.

This tough act I ain't worried about, that gun talk is mere threats.

I got a gun so big...that when I catch you,

I gotta let you slide, 'cause the train it's on ain't even here yet.

Fear death. Slugs push and leave a thug shook.

That mini gun got me walking like I was born with a clubbed foot.

Bitch nigga my whole mob stunting, everyone of 'em five dumping;

paramedics'll have to use pressure and apply everywhere like they job hunting.

I know Boston got gangs, but I ain't tripping 'cause im toy popping.

Throw them sets up. We ride through and pick at (picket) signs like we boycotting.

I'm doing you how a Boss should do; this gon be a loss for you.

They can't keep this puncher in a cage;

you know how much that would cost a zoo? (Kostya Tszu)

I'll give him that two jab concussion.

Its not the college in Boston when I give you mass (U. Mass) destuction.

Let me catch him with the mother of his child. You gon see him stretched.

First I'll lock up king pen, then ya B.M. F’ed.

But run up on me, you'll receive the biggest reception.

Bullets'll change your facial features when you witness protection.

I'm the truth, bitch. I'll grab the A.K. and get his roof split.

I'm accurate with them sticks like Rain Man with the toothpicks.

My nines peel. Every one of my lines real;

the way we'll bust Jerome you'll think we on Heinz field.

This strap is like when a girl invites you to watch Netflix,

‘cause when I add extensions,

bullets coming over to Chill with bad intentions.

You've made rash decisions, and you on the ground with this shit.

This wack emcee got another 2 rounds of this shit. Yikes!

Round Two
CHILLA JONES
So you told Danja, "being from the west and killing the east is what I encompass.”

And you call yourself a fuckin writer?

I mean that was a dope concept, but poor execution.

I would've thought of something tighter.

Like every round, I end(N) on top, and leave niggas right on E.

If you ever say I lost you’s a fuckin liar.

How could you rank me at the bottom, S-pecially when every battle I left with the W,

‘cause my schemes encompass fire?

Myers, this battle is your test. Let’s see if you can make it out.

If you pass, this could be 2015's greatest bout,

but if you fail, I’ll put a blade through your stomach, and take your navel out.

Get caught cheating, I'ma hold it against you like a faithful spouse,

then slice your shit. Then give you the replay pronto,

Killer Instinct with punches: I’m T.J. Combo.

Two cans, for you and your man, if he say dram, bro,

I’m clicking on y’all both like a three-way convo.

My squad gon get it in,

and you’a hear, more gunshots during this round than Jon Dough editing.

Steppin into your trapspot. Them glocks, we make it clap,

so guard all the buddha y'all weigh, or we takin that.

God, Allah, Buddha, Yahweh — that’s a divine scheme.

I had to make it clear for my pupil like Visine.

My team? It's a lot of us, don't bother us,

I’m trying to help this square get the picture like monitors,

so watch your men or a(menora) flame lighting like Hanukkah.

They lift your sole(soul) then shoo’ with the hammer like cobblers.

Watch how fast the room’a (rumor) spread like gossipers,

once shots sail on your shirt like Nautica.

Taking me was Gothika: a very wrong plan,

just a scary movie made to get buried(Berry) on cam,

damn. What you expected? Accept it, I'm spectacular,

You’ll get put in a coffin, Danny, the next Dracula.

Now bar for bar you think you the best battler,

the king author(Arthur)? ‘Cause you handled X caliber?

Or ‘cause it took your 3 best rounds to compete with Danja’s?

Well everything I’m speaking cold(code); that's a secret language.

My main bitch, she don't act like a lady.

Come at me sideways if you want. She'll be clappin that 80,

if his direct at me(hysterectomy), she ain’t having it, baby.

Now.. If y’all don’t know what a hysterectomy is, just wait it out,

the next two, I’ma explain what the wordplay's about.

You took me and Danja back to back. You the bravest scout.

Thought you was pussy. I ain't expect you to risk(uterus) being taken out.

Invade his house. From any angle I'm certain to kill shit.

Show you how to arc a tec: I'm the person to build with.

If it's beef and you the cause, B,(Cosby) I’m lurking to peel(pill) shit.

Mentally, I'm plain(plane) sick with a terminal illness;

This is realness. They say I lost to DNA. They had me wrong,

that was a bag, just over heads, but carry on.

Soon as I clap he gone, nigga the Bloque is riders.

Let you name a Top 5.... You ain’t a starter, Myers.

This is stardom, Myers. Y'all brought a star to Myers,

for his career to die in New York like Stoudamire’s?

I spark and fire, them cans get dumped, them hands could bump,

your back left with random lumps like camel humps;

Danny we could let it “bow” in the ring, but why handle guns?

When it’s Karate, kid, I’ll kick punches to get Daniel sonned.

You already know you on the ground with this shit.

This wack emcee got a whole nother round of this shit. Yikes.

DANNY MYERS
Your whole career, niggas complained about that boring shit.

Well I could give him nine to five, that'll make his whole morning shift.

Usually got the P89 with me, but if we get into a slug fest,

I’ma use the homie P like I'm trying to pass a drug test.

The iron'll squeeze.

You Mark Wahlberg: by the time you realize what's happening, you'll die in a breeze.

Bitch, I'll shoot your mama and your daddy. I’m creeping up where their home is.

Bullets gon out do em, they keeping up with the Joneses.

I gave your bitch my bottle of Henny; I bend these hoes.

She sucked me in the front seat of yo car; again she bold.

She swallowed Dan Brown, so when I made her moan,

a least a ho let me nut all over the Vin; she cold. (Da Vinci code)

It’s Mortal Kombat when they get me.

'Cause they never see the punches coming at ‘em like Kenshi.

But back to your bitch. That tramp is a Boston skeezer.

They said her head is past a ten, that's why I went off to meet her (off the meter).

Your mixtape? Wack as fuck! Not a single song I ain't feel once.

I'll raise a arm here (hair) if y'all like the songs that Chill bumps.

I'm too cold. I got a crazy maggie.

And five other small ones, but I really only fuck with two of ‘em like a baby daddy.

I'll run up and pop the chrome.

The first thing his man'll do is

pick him up and look at the face like when you drop your phone.

We’ll get guns you could hold in your hand, and some you carry over.

Then we'll surround this nigga spot like a areola.

You'll get buried soldier. Every day I'm carrying chrome.

My aura exudes to you a nefarious tone.

You get with bitches online, then you carry them home.

We ran track meets on the bitch who's marryin' (Marion) Jones.

You took my punches and mixed em with your schemes,

and you don't see nothing wrong about it.

I gave you power! I'll pull this gun and Nas'll write a song about it!

Banana clip hanging out of the K, you gon meet with shots.

You'll see this half moon in the middle of the day; that's a Equinox.

You think the beefing stops? I'll break your face in seconds.

Gun butt you til the stock destroyed. Your family be in a great depression.

Let me catch you with your homeboy. I real quick burst toolies.

You'll be sleeping with your man like Will Smith first movie.

I'm cold as Six Degrees; this the Separation before the tool peel.

Steel click (still clique) like when you break up with a bitch but y'all cool still.

Don't be a fool Chill, you coming at me with this rookie shit.

You seen how many niggas on cam I to'

from all the weak rhymes them pussies print.

Cam I to', camel toe, that's a reach, but that's the thing I'm slangin’.

But then again, when you reaching with the pussy that's finger bangin’.

You'll see my finger bangin', head shot; when they seen it, his men skirted.

The right stick have him thinking up is down like he inverted.

But yo! Guess who got shot in the dome piece?

Jerome's niece on her way home from Jones beach.

I'm Illmatic, and you on the ground with this shit;

this wack emcee got a whole nother round of this shit. Yikes!

Round Three
CHILLA JONES
I paid JC 600 dollars. Made a classic. Shit’s straight perfect.

You paid Rex twelve racks. For one fire round and two mixtape verses,

I mean, twelve racks? I mean, I'll never call you a cheap bastard,

but we all know, all you want in this game is elite status,

But for twelve racks? You could’ve battled Daylyt, Big Kannon and B. Magic

and traded that one weak battle for three classics, but lemme ask this:

where the fuck, was your manager, when you thought about this stupid plan?

How the fuck was paying Rex twelve racks supposed to improve your brand?

Yeah, you'se a man, with ten kids, but this is where you lose as a father,

‘cause do you know what twelve racks could do for a son or do for a daughter?

That's groceries for a year. That money coulda kept food in the fridge.

That's four months rent, plus furniture. Something new for the crib.

That's Disneyland for the summer, somethin special for you and your kid.

That's emergency money, in case you end up doin a bid,

but you ain't put your fam first. You gave that money to Rex.

You never paid dues, you paid dudes for your fuckin respect.

I don’t take it as disrespect when niggas ask me where my style is at,

‘cause I’d rather spend that money making sure my child’s intact.

This is real shit. Could give a fuck if the crowd react,

but I'm the motherfuckin KingPen, Danny.

It’s time to show you why they crowned me that.

Today’s your burial. I’m the KingPen, your games imperial,

I'm fuckin sick. It ain’t venereal. You ain’t ready, bro.

Homie I ain’t horsin’ around, this ain’t a merry-go.

Give his Pops Smacks over checks(Chex), it ain’t a cereal.

Rounds coming out of these cans, they ain’t spaghetti o’s;

I flip and catch bodies in the ring like Rey Mysterio.

Think a stereo: I could set(cassette) it on Danny and make a tool pop.

I got a new ox(AUX), and see these(CD’s) weapons gonna make dude stop.

I’m the type to come to your funeral as the tomb drop,

and throw dynamite in your casket. Now it’s a boombox.

Let him park on the strip while I'm standing on the rooftop.

He get stretched, pulling up under these caps like tube socks.

I’m too hot. This is haymakers and quick jabs.

They said you’d never take a loss to me(colostomy);

now you getting your shit bagged.

I’ll have goons pull up dumping hammers with crip rags,

and just for my amusement, park, repping them Six flags.

So get mad. Scream, nigga. Run around the whole stage.

You’ll probably be the first battler to die of old age.

I outline everybody. Then they disappear with no trace.

When I bare(beer) cans and hit his six pack, that’s a cold case.

Twin four-fours, that belong together like soulmates,

I let ‘em point, and scream out the window like road rage.

Toast blaze. Hella chrome, clicking like a metronome,

can to his ear like kids playing telephone.

Newsflash: We ran through your wife, and we was getting dome.

We was training that tongue better than Rosetta Stone.

Your last battle? 2-1 classic, I gave the edge to Zone.

‘Cause with a nigga like Danja, you can't just squeeze past em, you need action.

You gotta put that K in front of Carter. If he reverse then retrack him,

then keep blackin, wait. Most of y'all ain't even peep that.

Put a K in front of Carter, then reverse it, it spells retrack.

But I’ma relax. I’m only here to slump my next victim.

Y’all really thought he could overcome my best writtens?

Think Fetty Wap, he bout to be the one I(eye) left missing.

‘cause living? You can’t here(hear) Danny, this a death(deaf) mission,

I'm a vet spittin. What you know about the game?

Jones rounds insane, make him scream his slogan out in pain.

Your death tonight and Bobbi Kristina’s both about the same,

‘cause this was suicide, and now your life is going down the drain.

The crown remains with the KingPen, and that's why you losing now,

against Mister Jump-to-Top-Tier-from-the-Proving-Grounds. Bosstown.

DANNY MYERS
This nigga’s a false prophet. I felt he was a villain with a hunch.

That's why I'm coming to Jones town to kill him with a punch.

After this, you ain't doing no more battles.

The silhouette of my gun should’ve been a fore(four)shadow.

Chilla’s a workin man; I'll run up in his damn office.

Blow off both his legs; I come across stand offish.

You dead here. You gone be a martyr to your daughter.

This cat suited to be a pussy like Cheetara.

I'll call you a hoe holding a sword. Your skin, I’ll get under that.

This lion'll (Lionel) leave you in a West Brook.

That's how you scheme with the Thundercat.

You fuckin’ wack. I'll kidnap you in Boston; I'm really with the schemes.

The silencer won't say a word; you'll really miss the Bean (Mister Bean).

My team real. Can't no fuckin' man scare us.

Gun out the guitar case if you flashing a band, dare us. (Banderas)

I'm from a damn era where rap words got a rival shot.

Big L was still spittin', and Big Pun had the goggles cocked.

Souls of Mischief was banging from every car ride,

and west coast lyricists was trying to make it to the far side. (Pharcyde)

But here we are, god. Top pen games, you'll get your body burned.

Niggas ain't seen a better writer since Tommy Hearns.

As far as I'm concerned, this fag I gots to snipe.

This bitch just doesn't get it like Magic Johnson wife.

The irony in that line’s crazy! They thought we was the same,

but I'm the only sick one, even though we're contracted to let blood exchange.

Fuck Boss Town, I'll ride through your city and provide hecklers.

You'll see 22 coming out the Blazer like Clyde Drexler.

I'll side step ya. Break you off with a couple of rights.

I talk to niggas, you better come at a Brother polite (Polight).

I'd never run from a fight. I gave it all I had;

if a nigga want to get me to (meter) running he better call a cab.

I'll put you in a Boston crab, then let the choppa spit.

I'll put a hole, inside of this hoe, that's the size of a whole lotta shit.

Drama shit. He want a war, now we want a war.

But if all my niggas came in Chevys, how could you think we on one accord?

Daylyt started the schemes and you stole it. You a damn smoker.

I write scripts for niggas who bite: I'm Bram Stoker.

I'll hand choke ya. I ain't the one you should call out, boy.

You'll get rocked with metal ’til you fall out, boy.

You think I give a fuck about that 12k? I hustle, nigga; I see paper.

Keanu Reeves hit my phone 'cause he heard I was the Key Maker.

But you come up with all these genius schemes to set fire to yo raps.

I had to open up them bricks, then set fire to the wraps.

This nigga Myers fittin to snap on this nerd geek, word freak,

nigga get on. Writers Bloque the only block you ever been on.

Listen Scrap, skip the raps on how your fifth'll clap.

These pussies only act animated 'cause I’m a risk to cats.(aristocats)

It’s a difference, black. This notepad is my home.

In this battle shit, I’m the baddest guy known.

I honed him in on the fifth floor. So if Jerome’s in the house,

we’ll catch him by his window, drag and fly (Dragonfly) Jones.

Little fag I fly chrome. And you on the ground with this shit;

thank the lord he don't got another round of this shit. Yikes!Besides politics.. y’all wanna know why the layoff?

Well it’s hard for Dracula to reflect on the days he had to take off

and still Count the bodies that he ate off.

Oh, you revamp lines. Bitch besides that it’s the same flips,

I mean, left and right, it’s the same twitch;

you try to convince us the bars are different, but it’s the same shit.

You don’t shoot handgun after handgun,

you shoot hand gun, after hand gun, after hand gun,

bitch I grip the blade, (’s gon) be another fight that you ran from.

Wait, that’s a personal. Grip the blade, Sco, ‘nother fight that you ran from?

None of this is random,

I’ll lose my shit before I lose this shit, fist or shank, choose it quick,

but if you don’t pick and choose, I’ll choose the pick.

I’m super slick, but if you don’t get what I say,

he’ll get a bullet in his fuckin head,

it’s like that song by Chicago, he’ll be Dying In Your Arms Tonight,

It Must Have Been Something You Said.

I’ll leave him with PTSD, so pop a couple of meds,

turn on your night light, check under the bed.

Fans spent their whole life-supporting your flat lines

but it’s tough when you’re dead.

So instead, let’s exume the body.

Bring it back. Bruise the body.

You can see I threw hands. Illuminati.

(You can see eye through hands — Illuminati.)

Wait that may-send(mason) the wrong message, but who cares,

you punch reckless, you swing to swing with no connection and no connections.

Bitch I can do that too. And hit em harder because I’m smarter,

just say some shit like, “I’m a pistol sparker,

this can, sprays kin or came back, wait til it’s a little darker,

then pop up with one arm and take half his stash, that’s Hitler’s barber.

See, that’s just a better version of his shit. Yea, it sounds cold,

but why would I take half though?

Bro I can make a “complex” indirect bar about anything,

I’ll mention Christmas, like, “I’m right outside, I don’t care,-I’ll(carol) let it sing,

Santa Claus at a cemetery — what’s that mean?

Get Rudolph, rip, I’ll pull and slay(sleigh) everything.”

But you can’t do what I do. See I’m a dual threat,

I mean from this point on, everything you do’ll remind you of death.

Duel threat? Notice I didn’t say do will, I said do’ll again,

but it’s a different type of duel I had to build to.

Cuz I had to take ten steps back, just to wait my turn and kill you.

Bullets through your jacket.

Blood everywhere, the shit’s disgusting,

nothing but red coats. Ambulance dispatch is like

“the British are coming, the British are coming,”

this is a revolution. I’m Revered and <stutter> feared;

those scared of change are truly panicking,

but if y’all don’t see the light, I’m through with battling,

selling hookers or doing drive-bys, either way I’m human trafficking,

this is no accident,

I ain’t here to dwell on the past about how you didn’t do well in the past,

I’m here to fill in the facts, I’m killin him bad,

cameraman, you remind me of that weirdo from American beauty,

you gon spend this whole time filming a bag,

and you got two legs in like a sack race,

open your last days, what’s my rap name? My last name,

get used to it.

You will not prevail, you don’t got a shot in hell,

and tell these fuckin leagues my free will is not for sale. Early.

BORN
I said Born vs Gjonaj. The contract sent, I ain’t say a thang.

You was dead, soon as they signed an address (signin a dress) like Vera Wang.

Think The Hundreds. 2 guns, bomb on your shirt, cuz a pair ‘ll (apparel) bang,

get his head wrapped and buried in the sand, nigga. That’s a racial slang.

Should’ve been patient, lame. Now Gjonaj’s the patient’s name.

I’m a Damon Wayans —

A knife was the last thing you and your dogs seen; it was Major Payne.

We ain’t the same. I put in work in the streets, B;

dodgin police, tryna skirt on a DT,

so y’all think he really put work in to beat me?

Nigga I took the Gutta life worse than your P.G.

But we could throw the hands, you think it’s worth it to sneak me,

you’ll be losin grip with your soul(sole), you cheap searching for cheap sneaks.

My best defense in the club is reach for the steel(steal), he’ get hurt off a G.P.,

oh, see these(CDs) get organ, eyes, it’s a personal neat freak.

Believe me, the gun got a hair trigger. I could barely squeeze it,

snitch, I’ spill this pig’s blood all over this bitch, he’ get the Carrie treatment.

They love this nigga. Why? He be doin’ Hail Mary reaches:

Out-rhyme a don - out-Ramadan?

Well it might not be that much of a stretch,

cuz when they give him plates, he be rarely eatin’.

I’m prepared to beat him, it’s Bar Wars, I look around like “who’s who”,

peep this scheme, street niggas I’m with too lewd,

run in his Animal House and on cam I’ll use a Desert on this dune coon,

fuck the mic. Murderers step on the scene and air a goon room.

I move through. Tool shoot. This bitch get a red head when it fuckin Rain — Nunu;

or I’m outside on line with clips — Hulu;

get animated, dog, and I’m drawin the Macs — Goof Troop.

The bird pop out to clock niggas if they’re cuckoo.

By the way, tell that dancer stay on his toes,

it’s double trouble, a pair ‘ll wet (pirouette) him with the .22(tutu). (Woo!)

I got some screws loose, that’s why the violence shown,

we in survival mode, shoulda knew I’d whip you for the cash like a title loan,

this A-rab try and pose, I’ll fire chrome, they brought a lad in (Aladdin), so,

for all that Jazz, men(Jasmine) brains flying on the carpet..

now you can feel right at home.

I’m tryna start a riot though. But being ops on his resume.

You’d be more(B-more) likely to break your spine for the cops like Freddie Gray.

Nigga bein pussy ain’t nothin to celebrate,

pull a weapon later, he gon eat the butt of this bitch like Kevin Gates.

Set a date. Then I’m signin on the dotted line.

Lord to Allah, I got this bitch covered like Islamic pride,

plus I’m always strapped with this Glock of mine,

nigga it’s nothin funny bout this clip, it is not a Vine.

If your man rolled, you’d watch a core vet go from 0 to 100 like the Autobahn.

Dumping off nines for practice out the van like soccer moms.

You gotta die. On some real shit, you gettin killed, bitch,

one round down, you got two more to deal with.

Round Two
GJONAJ
Let’s take a walk through a guilty conscience.

But don’t judge due to lack of admission,

I have all the talent in the fucking world. But I lack the ambition.

The author of Frankenstein wrote,

“Of the danger of he who aspires to be greater than his nature will allow”,

which is fitting. ‘cause I’m a monster, man-made,

disrespected amongst these fake fucks,

and it’s funny ‘cause these dead bodies are my genetic make-up.

I was created from a series of alchemy treatments,

now I’m the next motherfucker you see Alchemist tweetin’.

What up Alc? I need a beat. Little bo no peep,

how could a shepherd with no cane be mad at the sheep?

‘cause where is it leading?

What good were those double meanings if they have no actual meanings?

You punch for nothing. Stop the shit.

This ain’t about bars, this is House of Cards;

I’m Kevin Spacey, I’m killing people over politics.

And I told you I should be left alone.

You fell for the trap they set you on,

I was cement shoes disguised as a stepping stone.

Now walk on water. You get it yet?

I’m a breath of fresh air, was that too indirect?

You need me to live.

Fuck torture; I walk on hot coals smoking a cigarette,

mocking your silhouette,

you’re a shadow of a shadow of a man

who got goaded into being a sacrificial lamb,

and now you’re gettin slaughtered, and all of em have to witness it;

so what if he has to die, when I’m the one who has to live with it?

What a shame. He tried to altar his image in six minutes,

and now he’s on the altar, there’s a big difference.

He still doesn’t get it. I will. Not. Lose.

Look in my eyes. That pain and violence, insane asylum.

I’d rather be against the ropes than hang inside em.

Upholding a legacy,

but still watchin out for Judas ‘cause loyalty’s sold separately,

these new friends are looking like old enemies,

but as soon as your name buzzing they come back like… old memories.

My craft is Minecraft: so how I control the building?

It’s fucked up when every you know’s(nose) crooked like Owen Wilson.

So when I’m done, please cut the check, I don’t need the respect,

you never drug shit, that’s the placebo effect.

Why sugar coat it?

Fuck the book and who wrote it, I noticed you say shit for the fuck of it.

I had enough of it.

You leave a message after the tone; I leave a message because of it.

Born, I’m killing you and they’re lovin’ it,

I mean even if I let you live, I’d still get charged with cruel and unusual punishment.

I don’t believe in bad luck, but since this black cat crossed me, let’s run with it.

I shaved with pieces of a shattered mirror for the past 7 years,

I don’t believe in karma.

But when your turn comes back around, you’ll realize you don’t deserve this.

Life isn’t perfect. Everyone Born has a purpose.

Lemme ask you something, bitch. Was it worth it?

BORN
Nigga, you gettin sheer beheaded.

I would say this is a disaster in the making, get ready to clear the wreckage,

but this is a Dizaster in the making; y’all got me battling Bashir the second.

Wait, let’s clear the record.

This’ll shake you to the core, ‘cause the Mac ‘ll choose disaster,

honestly, whose man(-)made this wreck?

Forcing aggression; he ain’t even a natural Dizaster,

nah, let’s revamp that,

you fresh off the assembly line, they packaged you Dizaster,

there was a category for(four), any damage done,

then you would be an actual Dizaster.

This is facts you aught to capture. Why mention me?

When you stole your flow, cadence and delivery?

The epitome of a PG clone, steppin with some energy and imagery.

Nigga please. How you dissing me when you Diz to me?

I see you got with the right(-)click to copy-paste your history.

It was meant for me to body his ass quick.

How you emulate a nigga between 2 jobs and a cab shift?

You idolize another man. I know your father is mad pissed.

Suckin dick. Tryna rack a tier(racketeer)

but he the weakest Dizaster to come out the D since Kwame Kilpatrick.

But enough of that shit.

Try and picture this guy in trenches.

I’ll leave this Arab Chin swole, like Harold and Kumar on slider binges.

You blew up on Gutta. So what? He was kinda timid.

Just ‘cause you bombed on a plain(plane) nigga

doesn’t make you an Al Queda member.

2 years, no losses. I gotta make this guy remember?

When a solider give him a Red Skull it’s not a Hydra center.

I’m about to defile this sinner and get him carried out.

Matter fact, this battle reminds me of a book in the bible.

Oh you get it or doubt I’m following the lord’s orders,

rocking the boat and going overboard when it’s a clearer route,

somebody tell Gnojaj bein’ swallowed by the belly of the beast

something he shouldn’t wear about.

Please, don’t start no drama, ‘cause I’ll air it out.

Nuborn’s known to cradle caps like damaged scalp.

Y’all niggas remind me of the logo from Paramount,

circle all around stars with a mountain on screen and nothin that we care about.

I prepared this bout. I’m a claimin the win.

I heard you called JC a nigga.

Well I dare you.. Nah, nah, nigga I triple dog dare you to say it again.

You racist within? I’m breaking your chin.

You feel golden, I(Goldeneye) blow cartridges

to get him split on screen like he playin with friends.

There’s no gangsta in him.

Calicoe said it’s a difference between metaphors and real <write(misspeak)> rap.

Yeah, Cal, you right, the difference is, once he met a four it was a real wrap.

Real rap. I mean you right in your hometown,

so everything you say, these people gon go wild,

but just remember: I gave y’all the lowdown, so y’all should know now,

the real disaster is him not using his own style. (Blow.)

Round Three
GJONAJ
When you underestimate a man who has no losses,

you die for no reason, that’s natural causes.

So with all this your fault, you were never warned?

I mean the telltale heart beats never more,

there’s not a single light round, so what are you headed for?

You might not die, but you gon wish you were never Born.

There’s shit worse than death. You gon suffer another fate.

The shit ain’t black and white. You’re looking at another race,

so who gon finish line, the first to cross,

now that you mention it I’m not white,

we try (wheat, rye) to talk it out

til I pull a pistol or pump a nickel, wait —

that could be said different:

white, wheat, rye, pumpernickel, we BRED different.

I’m molded in this image to offer repentance.

So picture a holy descendant

standing over the fuckin hole he descended,

oh wow. You predicted religion would be a part of my angle.

Congratulations. One shot through your top get a halo

then I look over the body like, “How ironic. Once he drop his guard, he an angel.”

But I guess that’s what they made heaven for.

What’s the expression? “Knocking on the devil’s door”?

Well I answered. Should I kill him in reality or kill him with quotes?

Should I put him through hell or send him to hell?

Fuck it, damned if you do, damned if you don’t.

I’m Little Nicky brother, I raise hell on Earth, so just act religious.

Bullets exit ‘is temple, let’s take that a bit farther,

statues cryin’, I’ll make rock bleed, that’s stigmata.

Who want it with me? Tell me the truth, though.

Slingshots, give me my regular props,

in other words don’t lie if you wanna get rocked.

I’m that nice. Call it congregation.

I grab the hatchet, have a conversation

with his frame: chop it up.

Rosetta Stone body language, this has gotta stop.

When trust falls in the wrong hands, you see a body drop.

Now you gotta watch me put him out of his misery.

Or let him try to belittle me while legends are diggin’ me,

but if they don’t pass me the torch, I’m literally

stealing the Statue of Liberty.

You could’ve left with your dignity.

But you had to get it so here’s an actual threat,

I’ll fuckin snap his neck

and have him looking over his shoulder like it ain’t happened yet.

I bet paranoia’s the only thing that’s beaming from him.

The grim reaper cast an image that should keep him running,

the irony if it wasn’t for shadows, you wouldn’t even see it coming.

But that means nothing when you’re dead and rotting.

And that’s the fuckin problem, I’m not even done with rhyming

and I’m talking to a spirit like a fuckin shaman.

But this is my native language.

Chill, it’s just a game I’m playing,

I kill the animal and make sure not a part is wasted.

Born, your death for the following statement:

I’m a serial killer. Are you following?

There’s a cult fanbase that’ll only make it worse.

I’m Charles Manson: I control killers with my favorite verse.

You wanna know how to catch me slipping?

Read his latest work.

You can’t protest cutting trees with paperwork.

So fuck it pick a side, I decide who can live and die,

if you don’t get it I’m

the firing squad: I’ll kill you all with a single line.

Are you afraid of death? Relax, take a breath.

Organik and Gully are here. This is a major step.

But if I created this fuckin path for you, I literally made your step.

What’d you expect?

My son was starving. I let him eat with the grown-ups, I didn’t need to.

And you disrespected me by biting the hand that feeds you.

And now you finally fuckin realize who needs who. (Goodnight.)

BORN
It’s crunch time, so I’ma do what I do best. Punchlines.

Like I said before,

you got your flow from another nigga. You cheatin’, pal,

disaster when this fruit biting.

That’s who you guardin’? God, I’m at ‘im, even now.

Fuck you, I’m tryna body Surf off the stage.

That’s how you reach the crowd.

This bitch get addressed, it’s night-night,

that’s a sleeping gown.

Take a L. B.S., if it’s beef, he gon meet the pound.

Off principle, you and your faculty ‘a

eat a mill together like the teacher’s lounge.

If we go hard, your chest (Chess)

cookin’ when I Steams it down.

Feel like Gandhi when I’m drinking:

a li’l Hindu ‘ll help me spread the piece around.

Christ the second coming? Well nigga you need Jesus now.

These punches non-stop. You Taken one too many.

Liam Nieson style. See the pow.

So smooth with the 40, it’ll make Carlisa smile.

Give this whore a scope. Snake.

You see the scales on this bitch? He a Libra now.

Fuck it, I’ll heat this clown.

Silencer. The gun won’t make a peep or sound;

it’ll whisper, I promise. Like a secret vow.

I’ll creep in town. Like a bar with Parkinson’s,

I’m ready to shake and open for the fade,

Heath Ledger, before the clip drop this Joker saw the grave.

If this Bozo saw<stutter> the pain I’m out here dolo, more than brave.

It’s Anarchy, get hype man and catch a back slap,

that’s O-Solo versus Swave.

This homo’s so afraid he won’t stand for himself.

But if I force your hand, you better play the hand you was dealt.

Wait, speaking of “hand you was dealt”,

I heard that you worked as a casino as a fuckin card dealer.

(No, seriously.)

I mean you gettin money. I mean it’s no way for me to flip this, y’all,

but at least they know what they meant

when they said he was gonna flip this card.

This bitch is soft. Wouldn’t even hold a can.

I let it go, find him booking under chair like a Oprah fan.

Royal flush. See your poker face? Better show your hands,

buddy won’t gamble with the odds.

I bet when the chips are down he just fold his hands.

Hold it, fam. I’m the ace in the hold. You can’t match potential.

Call your bluff, you need to follow suit, or your ass gets stenciled,

told him ante up at least a stack to ripple.

Nigga look, soon as I was booked the cards was stacked against you.

Nigga it’s the gas they give you, that’s the issue.

They like when you all shouting.

My lines come across screen for viewers without the ball bouncing.

Every night I’m sharp with the bar jousting.

But why black, Jack? When I can see no one on the card counting.

Now that was fire. Fuck it, I got the four crouching,

extend-o take out a couple Jokers lost in the shuffle,

and still have fifty on deck, since we card counting.

Now, that was fire too.

Let’s revamp it again. We in the yard pouncing,

like the movie. Soon as it’s spacey, he’ll have 21 in his head,

like he was card counting.

(If you seen the movie 21, Kevin Spacey, he was card counting..)

(I said fuck it.)

We beyond shouting. I’m playing to win.

Say he gon get me, fuck it, he won’t say it again.

But y’all know my slogan. It’s faces still or face the steel,

the love is love but nigga the hate is real.Smack, is you ready? Charlie, you ready, handsome?

Charlie Charlie, are you real?

When the make believers wanna make you a believer.

In a room full of dream chasers, that started chasing the dreamer.

Oh this gon be a nightmare.

I got to wake you for me, bruh as fake as can be but

I know you ain't gone just stand in this ring to be layin’ there beat up.

My man said, “Charlie comin’ to fight.” Shit, I would think he would need ta.

As much flak as you got for not being in L.A. with them sneakers, nigga.

Nah, he ain’t gon be slipping, baby.

Well shit, I ain’t gon play with you neither.

In fact I'm gon say some things,

and I really could care less how you take to it either.

Think I’m just showing up with these Wrestlemania features.

Smell what I’m cookin’, nigga I will Rock your eye,

looking to box the five, and you ain’t gotta pay Little Caesar’s.

Did y’all know (Digiornio) he can walk amongst the Tombstone

tonight, home Slice? And this ain’t for no pizza.

You can say I’m a preacher, a Panther, Rich Porter,

a YMCA dancer, whatever, they gon laugh, you entertaining.

I just figured in the age where trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers,

well, don’t sendin a message take a certain number of characters to explain it?

Like how me, myself, and I, already dangerous but schizophr*(ay)*nic;

You a Harlem hustler that will black out with the shotguns on the stages;

I kill you in front of Mom, free of charge,

and then pay for your whole funeral arrangements.

Goddammit, you bet I'm back.

Chuck, you the one that should've suited up for this, nigga, you forever slacks.

You could've got prepped for that, it helps to match.

Do it for your Vines... see where I address you at.

Look at grandmama bow tie; I'ma go at his neck for that.

Bow ties, bean pies... yeah you could rebuttal that.

Yeah, they say you a good nigga; I fought greater.

All labor boss, on paper you a 4th grader.

All you do is take a dope line or a gun bar,

you just reference that with a sports player; you short paper.

Fat boy, you couldn't get down with me with Rick Ross trainer,

nigga, just cause you got tits, brah

don't mean you be thinking in broad layers. C’mon player.

It's in the talk. Scratch that, it's in the walk.

You gotta look at how the boot leg cut,

if you copy that, this Clip(’)s a fraud; picture's off.

Who you are really in your bars, nigga?

Cause I know you for being soft, not for flipping hard.

Now you this nigga with attitude.

Just cause Trey chillin' with a cold block,

that don't make him Cube, don't get me wrong.

Yeah, you a Boy N Tha Hood, with the job.

If your man deal heavy, I feel worried: they kick the door,

you tell them where the Pills Buried,

see, you not the Doughboy that you think you are.

(Woohoo!) I’m just poking holes in him.

Loaded-Lux-vs-Charlie-Clips-Lux
Y'all probably couldn't relate to this.

Besides, Hollow showed me

you wouldn't be good with a business relationship.

Sike, I lied... how you just letting niggas just take your shit?

What's crazy is, if I break up with people,

cause we didn't get along, I know when to pass the baton

in this human race we in.

You can't tell that to a nigga without a car.

Just him and his T-Mobile, the minute you rollover

he trying to play you like a sim. They was him.

All the ex-producers and the managers,

Planning to be in my top five Fave Friends,

then they find out they ain't got drive for the long run,

that's when they came to Sprint, but this a Marathon we in.

The family still here, my whole pack at the thriller.

Lil' one, my mama, I'm riding, backseat full of killers.

We on our way to Lenox.

I wish a funny ass acting nigga would make a move,

but you ain't never been(Ben) stiller.

Still I, told my dog I can't let this cat shit on the litter.

Wreck and tangle my circle of life,

the world is round, you could kill me now;

how I’ma flat leave my niggas?

Even Real Aliva hit my jack late

He said, "yo man he just,

came through the hood with Goodz rambling,

how you want handle it?"

I said, "chill. He just feeling you out. It's good, he panicking."

This is what happens when these niggas get creatively famished

and can't manage it.

Their mental feeds be fishing cause they ain't bred

for this type of meet, but you could hook up the sandwiches.

I mean look, you got whatever advantages, could be damages.

Standing in your lobby, I'm thinking how he,

put his rounds together, that's a sign, that nigga outty.

I’ve been planning this,

to rap circles around a body. Nigga you lucky, it could be bandages.

My youngin' tried to get the hammer in;

I said, “wow that type time he ain't on, you way off.”

You talk that hustling shit, nigga,

but bacon the only strip you ate on.

I don't know why you call yourself Clips. nigga.

You got your name wrong.

I bet the last name he drew on a nigga he had Crayons.

The fake niggas you gotta pray for.

I'm not gonna preach to him, he no disciple.

Just indecisive. You got a right to question what I might do

after that last one we had to fight through.

But here's where I break the cycle. In case you feel delightful.

That moment that Mook hit me I got a bit more insightful.

I love my people, but some niggas, they just ain't gon like you.

You can't give your life to.

Malcolm read his scripture, hoping he got the picture

but the only one you remember is at the window with the rifle.

Have faith, cause you in here with the meanest, nigga,

and we gon need you to mean it.

Lately you come around (a round),

but you ain't never got three that’s completed.

Everybody's DNA structure different,

But he not me or the screening.

I'm genius. That gray hoodie Lux who rhyme vibe smooth,

fused with crime rules, why lose?

I'm coming to win(d) like a typhoon,

fine tune, every bar with the gun: high noon.

In the field, raisin’ on a nigga like dry prunes.

CHARLIE CLIPS
Summer Madness 5, wow, like where do I even begin?

First off, I got to salute Hollow for giving me that

li’l.. scratch on the chin.

Making me bleed in our last fight

‘cause it’s exactly what I needed again.

‘Cause I suffer from a disease called try-to-give-a-fuck-entitis,

it’s a disease that makes me not eager to win.

Now I’ve been diagnosed since 2012,

no nurse or no doctor would even give me a suggestion.

So I battled rookies and legends,

hoping somebody can help me learn my lesson.

I play around in every battle,

but nobody can kill me. “How” is the question.

But then I realized it’s not a disease, it’s God,

and I will no longer play with my blessing.

Ah Beloved, you had the world, but after the Calicoe battle,

it seems like you’s been getting demoted.

How ironic, you wanted Murda and you got murdered,

but I don’t want to hear that you wasn’t devoted,

‘cause every battle rapper in this building wanted to be Lux.

Oh, but never did Charlie, nigga you know it.

I tried to take a Hollow out in front of you, Smack.

What makes him think Clips want to be Loaded?

I need to know: are you Muslim or are you Christian?

Nigga, you’ve been confused since about eighty three.

Yea, you right, you was Rich Porter, and then a Black Panther,

and in your next battle you may be me.

Now when you came up with that slogan “you gon’ get this work”,

that sent chills down my spine, that shit was crazy, B

But the work you give out don’t last that long nigga:

you the temp agency.

You left battle rap and I held us down,

but y’all quick to welcome him home without the doormat.

Hey, what his resume like? He beat Miles, he beat Cal,

who gives a fuck? We don’t condone that,

you lost to Mook and Hollow, O-Red got a better resume

than you, nigga, and now we know that

So it’s like Fabolous spelling his name, ‘cause you should be where O at.

I’m killing scrap. Right now, it’s a nigga paralyzed

watching the pay-per-view like, “oh, I’m feeling that.”

I conceal a gat, I don’t care how much holmes improving,

I put this hammer to where his ceiling at.

One look big and the other one sound big,

that’s Shyne featuring Guerilla Black;

Brrriippa, bap! Blow his socks on his head,

it’s looking like Chilla hat.

Yes, dude is back, for y’alls who don’t

understand what I’m saying, it’s Mr. Google Facts.

Once again, my flow’s so out of this world,

I advise you to get your Google Maps.

I catch Lux while he running to his ride.

Beloved, then use the strap

Make him pay before he enter the ride, this shit a Uber app.

Nigga, I’m super strapped, and I’ll

spill him all over the stage like a Smack drink.

Or catch him and his crew getting high,

then walk in and let the gat brrring,

headshot blow his brain by his Puma,

basically I don’t give a fuck what this cat think.

The cops’ll find his Caesar

next to some Dutches, welcome to Black Ink.

What’s up Beloved?

Is you gonna shut the fuck up or not?

‘Cause you’re soft on Lenox,

but you always act tough up the block.

I’m in (mother z?) with the pump,

hitting his door with a couple of shots.

This shit a Puff deal,

it was especially made to fuck up the locks(Lox).

I’m in his crib looking for his niggas,

‘cause I’m about to do them grimy.

Me and my pump just kicking it,

sounding like a song from the nineties.

They like, “who can I run to?”

Lux like, “all y’all get behind me”

What I want to know is, how do y’all plan to

Xscape if the leader is looking Tiny?

This is for all you motherfuckers that said Clips ain’t nice.

Right now, Eddie Murphy is

calling Martin like, “this ain’t Life.”

Tay Roc is watching the battle like, “this ain’t light.”

And Quentin Miller is tapping Drake like, “this ain’t write.”

I tried to relax. Oh, but y’all don’t respect me

until CC buggin’. You see me dumpin’.

Burners on his back, I guess his CD buzzin’.

Everybody getting staples, this mac got a easy button.

So many straps, it look like Ms. Fit and C3 fucking.

What’s up with you, Beloved?

What are you gon’ tell the crowd, Beloved?

How I wasn’t outside battle rapping with Tru, Millz and Ice?

OK cool. I can’t lie, ‘cause of my father life, my moms kept me inside

I played video games and ate some damn pie

But when I did come out, I was that nigga,

and I watched Rex kill you on Eighth, I seen this man fry.

So if you battled on the roof and the loser had to jump,

either you ass betted or you can’t die.

I just want to know what it is.

Oh you talking to me while the crowd going crazy.

See that’s your problem, you don’t know how to work the heckler.

Stomach shot, paramedics surprised,

they forgot how to work the stretcher.

They’re like “where we gon’ take him”,

he said “Harlem Hospital giving beds out, that’ll work, whatever,”

But the hole so big,

Harlem Hospital and Presbyterian got to work together

I know y’all was scared to bet on Charlie

‘cause y’all ain’t know what kind of Clips y’all would get today.

Funeral thoughts, I got a box on my mind,

you think I’m kidding, play (Kid ’n Play).

My brother want to shoot the shit out you,

but I don’t really need for his cig to spray.

You know how many niggas I

will Smith by myself, this Independence Day.

I need to talk to you, Beloved. Tell the world how

you started my career. I mean go ahead and floss, nigga.

But it don’t matter right now

‘cause Smack is both of our boss, nigga.

So you can go ahead with all that bullshit,

I advise you to go and floss, nigga

And we ain’t seen your son since the video on BET,

(stutter)let me find out that you’re becoming a lost nigga.

Round Two
LOADED LUX
And now for my second trick.

You’re the first battle rapper with a 360 deal, nigga,

I’m not guessing this. We got references.

Ever since you let this hairy nigga play J.G. Wentworth,

I watched when your whole worth went

into a small structured settlement.

Eight battles for $50,000, my nigga? What are you, Mexican?

Hold on, no disrespect if you like hard work or some extra shit.

But if you’re gon’ rap, then rap nigga,

don’t be in blogs acting like the moves you’re making

is so executive, I’m not impressed with it.

You sign major ass deals, but Goodz still got to help you

and drive you to all of your press events.

And all he got to show-fer (chauffeur)

is a bottle of that brown drink.

Half a Gallon Goodz ain’t even got a half a gallon in the tank.

You know I’m the only battle rapper

out here breaking the bank, nigga.

He don’t like hearing that.

Nothing you kick wavy, nigga,

I don’t even know why you’re wearing that.

These type of niggas, they for y’all. They like that show on Starz,

nah. I’m into authentic power.

Where in a hour, you didn’t got to act like 50 Cent ain’t enough,

so disrespect, you’ll allow it.

How you talking principle shit? Well, I never attended Howard.

But as a student of the game, I know you just can’t claim

to be a man and not put on them trousers.

I watched you gun talk a nigga for three minutes straight,

my nigga. Bullet showers.

We just want to know, well where was the tec

when Big Cheese kept your 750 dollars, nigga?

You’re starting to look like a pretty flower, nigga.

This video game ass nigga.

Who you up here putting on for? You a cornball.

Wait, wait, we knew this nigga way before y’all.

Yeah, you moved to Eighth, nigga, but you was in the house.

I never seen somebody put two in a nigga’s scalp

just shooting off at the mouth.

Eyy, you’re right, I know what you’re confused about.

‘Cause you did work at Presbyterian Hospital as a janitor.

That figures, I’m used to realigning you Smack niggas.

Beasley, I’m gonna get this money,

it don’t mean I got to be glad rapping with trash niggas.

The only thing you ever been strapped for was cash, nigga.

A Harlem nigga with no bread, a Harlem nigga with no bread.

Big Bird, you’re a featherweight on hesitate.

We all on the conference call, Smack’s trying to delegate

the match all extra safe

for this pepper-steak on a breakfast plate ass nigga trapped,

looking for his best escape,

I said, “bet another K your man don’t show up on time, Smack,”

“But why’s that?” I said “‘cause dead niggas always late.”

This nigga scared, 40-Year-Old virgin

ain’t had as much pressure on a date, man.

This what happens when you’re rapping,

chasing checks at the gate.

Betting against a great then guessing at the debates.

Chess is what I play.

And if Couture know the game, she knows it’s over

once a nigga get checked in front of his mate, waaait.

You thought you was quite the winner

But she was on BET, not you, nigga.

I see who wear the pants in your cypher, sister.

Charlie, you’re the bitch in the D?

He the type of nigga act like he don’t type remember

But shoutout to my boss bitches wifing niggas.

Make sure you hit ‘em with the prenup.

I came to fight, fat boy, sleeves up.

I roll up on this nigga like a pants cuff,

break his whole dance up, pop lock.

I want a whole tour Couture, handsome,

how long you gon cockblock?

It’s time, Smack, why your fake shooter

always worried about the shot clock?

This stopwatch ass nigga, you probably

rather a laptop over them backshots.

That flabby bag ain’t built to last,

you get in, pull the trigger fast,

That’s black ass, not black ops,

you’re confused, nigga.

You Charlie Clip, I’m fully Loaded.

You ain’t even a trailer in my movie, snapshot.

Ain’t no future in fronting, backdrop.

You’re in here with the main attraction, mascot.

His looking ass? Your looking ass

wasn’t even good cash up in Ash twat.

You spent all that time at the slots, nigga,

and can’t never hit the jackpot.

Charlie Clips getting them chips again.

Last bet, what happened?

Couture said he lost the rent again.

When the gambling man shook up,

that’s usually when he should pass the dice.

You sat for like two years without a match to fight.

Was you in U N?

I could care less if Cam gave you cash for flights,

unless you have the lights.

Nigga, you could’ve been Channing Tatum in flashy tights.

Your career wouldn’t take off if you was Magic Mike, nigga.

Oh, this is an embarrassing night.

Look at your savior.

Up here getting your ass beaten, nigga.

Don’t you ever throw rocks at the sun,

you can’t reach it, nigga.

Work, nigga.

CHARLIE CLIPS
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish;

Knick knack patty whack, give a dog a bone,

two thousand, double zero, party oops, out of time,

my bacon is smelling fine.

Loaded-Lux-vs-Charlie-Clips-hat
Every time you talk, that’s what we hear.

We got a Muslim that eat pork. Allah, the end is near.

Watch how I break this nigga down for half a round

and won’t even let the tec spark.

If y’all saw my battle against Jones, well shit,

y’all know this the round where I stretch marks.

Do you know I actually tied my shoe in a perfect knot

so the world wouldn’t see my sneakers sliding?

And I took a trip to Africa, dug deep

in the earth’s surface but couldn’t reap a diamond?

Oh, he wasn’t being honest.

And Beasley, Smack is not that good at keeping timing.

I know you want him to keep the rhyming to be the giant,

but this the part tonight where David have to beat Goliath.

Listen, Beloved. I’m going back to my Lionz Den days,

the days that made me a beast,

where you watched me break the Roc apart,

felt like a Dame, Chris, maybe a Neef.

Oh they was calling you Jay-Z, unique,

oh but you went from Jay-Z to Bleek in maybe a week,

ironic how them Back-to-Back losses

turned you from a Drake to a Meek.

I saw you on Total Slaughter, it was total slaughter,

oh that wasn’t the way to compete.

Mook smoked through a foot,

but you was the one tasting defeat.

The way you got your ass whipped,

you should’ve sued Eminem, Shady at least

Oh you got a lot of money, that’s the Beauty,

but that’s not what make you a Beast.

See, you turned into a money whore, Beloved.

I could see you on the phone with Beasley now,

like “oh, I’ma do this for the public.

Oh Beasley, put me in the ring

with the boy, Clips, oh, they gon’ love it.

Oh, but I need to know what’s in the budget.

30,000? Ah, that’s just a nugget

You know your boy Loaded need to eat,

I’ma need more chicken just like a bucket.

Oh I’m doing this shit for the love,

I ain’t doing this for the vulture.

I’m doing this for me,

this thing is for the culture.”

Mmm oh my god, stop fucking lying.

“Oh no, I’m serious, like I do this

for my niggas up north full of that jack mack

that’s doing a bid,

for the little ones in Africa

with the flies wrapped around they ribs,

I’m doing this for all you people

that can’t get in the crib,

I’m doing this all for the kids

and that’s the way that it is.”

Mmm oh my god, stop fucking lying.

You battle rap for the money, Beloved,

but just keep it a hundred, that’s why this nigga slipping.

You think we’re in the same field financially?

Okay y’all, this nigga tripping.

Nigga listen, I know we’re black brothers,

both successful, but I’m on a bigger mission.

Roy Rogers and Popeyes:

our skin may look the same, but the chicken different.

Do y’all remember when I turned to Shang Tsung at NOME 5,

and the crowd went crazy, and it even left Hollow a little rattled?

We’ll I’m back with the same powers, but now I got one

where I can turn into niggas that I ain’t even battle.

Another 5’9” nigga with a death wish.

Baking his egg with this toast from the side, who want breakfast?

I slide up on him, three guns, fuck a dead kick.

Everything used on sight(site), that’s Craigslist.

My bitch will chase him down with the pumps,

I guess she desperate.

Y’all came to see Clips get Loaded, I guess that’s Netflix

I still pull that piece like Jenga, let that tec spit

And put his block back in their place, oh now that’s Tetris

You know what’s up with me, Beloved?

If you think this battle’s anywhere close and you’re

watching this, you must be out your motherfucking mind.

I’m a psycho, I ain’t even got it all in my motherfucking mind.

I’ll run up in your mother’s crib with a knife,

like fuck a motherfucking nine.

Put the shit to her wrist

and cut through your mother fucking time.

I dare these niggas to try to celebrate after this,

that’s when we crash the party.

He gon’ be crying “oh, Beloved need another shot,

I want a rematch with Charlie.”

Well I’ll tell you what, if you survive the pump

and it don’t detach your body,

I’ll go in the Arsonal again and make you rematch the Shotty.

Round Three
LOADED LUX
We’re coming down to the wire.

How you help to solve over 30 homicides

and ain’t take not one nigga down with a wire?

I see where you get your talk game from.

Apparently, everybody and your mother

know your pops went out like a sucker, nigga.

Lisa could read, we aren’t deceived.

Fans, y’all knew I would probably pick at this issue,

that wasn’t hard to achieve.

But bet I do it better than every artist you’ve seen.

As smart as he seem, to think to cut off that part of the ring.

We just gon share that half a square

while we wait here, and park up the scene.

‘Cause this the spot, nigga.

Where Rex popped off and didn’t accomplish a thing.

I’m taking shots,

but I’ma stop at every bar in between.

What Hey Arnold got

to Schwarzenegger, strong on the machines,

pull up short

when I come out the rock like Arthur the King.

You’re ‘bout to pop.

I hope you read every comment they leave.

For every man your mother picked to be a father to breed.

We know about Nut. Your little brother Jiggy Josh is a seed.

Let’s give it up,

see this is what the audience need,

‘cause y’all be stuck,

y’all don’t know what Charles to believe,

but I know Chuck,

the one who wears his heart on his sleeves.

That shit was rough. I’m watching you and Hollow,

how low you’re depicting Harlem on screen,

you dissing friends then whispering like y’all was a team

and that was a part of the scheme.

I watched you air out a nigga dirty laundry

to make sure it get cleaned;

that’s the same thing your pops, when he got indicted, tried,

talking like he fighting crime.

Agreement got ripped up

when he tried to tell them “sike, I lied,”

but that’s why he got life inside.

Pardon my steam.

But dad making us look bad, I can’t honor that, king

I don’t know about grandpops. But I know it starts with the genes

And DNA got me wishing

we could lift your Lennox apartment to Queens,

but wait, that’s still New York. Well all that just means

is that the apple doesn’t fall too far from the trees.

You and your punk ass daddy a couple of chatty Patties, nigga.

Acting catty, “meow”

Math was swinging, you was standing there playing caddy.

I thought you was a killer, Charles: Lee Ray.

I thought Chucky wasn’t no joke. He just think he DeRay.

You might be a DJ the way you..

turn on niggas in the jam you’re with.

You switched on Cor and Chambers,

after you let their man get whipped.

Damn it, Clips. I know comedians don’t do candid scripts

And you’re a funny ass acting nigga too,

but that wasn’t no stand up shit, nigga.

That ain’t hard to miss, that’s just Charlie Clips

The two-faced ass nigga

who got the dimples with the Harvey dent.

He get it from his mom and them.

‘Cause you know pops didn’t raise him, you know

She was the gangster on the front line foot first,

this could hurt, and look worse

let’s go back in store, she remember Woolworth.

Jesus was a carpenter, and right now,

this is where he get to coming out the woodworks.

Nigga, you’re ‘bout to get this good work.

I say look, this ain’t even a side bar:

his mother was a side chick.

Tell Lisa Ree, we could read the lease was up on the fine print,

but she needed someone to provide rent.

But why every guy she went to moved around blow?

I’ll tell you. ‘Cause at the time she was chasing that paper,

it wasn’t to put food in any mouths, so

Y’all might be thinking out loud “hoe”.

No, I know his mother, she proud folk.

But money was rolling through that number hole

and she wasn’t about to lose count, so.

After your daddy, she got with your little brother daddy,

and they got wild close.

And P-Nut was up ‘til the peoples picked him up,

and you know, things change when trial close,

and the smiles go. I don’t know, coke or they found dope,

but he wasn’t on track, started running his lips,

putting names in laps, then smacked right into a milestone.

The whole town know, even if the crowd don’t,

that nigga P-Nut told on Alpo.

But look how it come around though.

It’s no wonder why in your raps,

you’re always mentioning the trap, nigga.

‘Cause your mother was into the corner chasing cheese

and ended up with some rats, nigga.

That’s a Snapple top fact.

“The nerve of a nigga,

get a bunch of lies from niggas and try to make it work.

I got sixteen racks, and I’ll give you half of that

if you can provide me with paperwork.”

That’s what you said, right?

I figured that was a ploy to find out where the paperwork is.

Which would’ve been smart, ‘cause you know,

you don’t want that to maybe resurface.

What happens when rehearsing being dangerous

ain’t working, could lead to hearsing?

See, what happens when niggas rapping

get caught faking in their verses?

They say you was nervous, I heard when they contacted you

to pay it, he was playin’ like he ain’t had a paper to purchase.

So let me find out, my nigga.

You ain’t had a paper to purchase?

Don’t mind that, what happened?

It either is or it ain’t that, nigga say that.

So you don’t mind that I brought the homie Faybach.

I figured you could come and give him his eight stacks in person, nigga.

Don’t act like you ain’t got the money neither, nigga.

I know what we made off our purses.

(Get that shit out there, man. Let niggas see what’s happenin’.)

This is street justice and I can prove it.

I want to send a special shout out to

Farris, my man BD, the big homie Lou Simms,

and the rest of those that was on that same case that never told. True friends.

I’m on the phone with Farris, we rapping,

he like “man, if I would’ve only knew then.

But here’s this new den number, 2 8 7 0 0 - 0 5 4”

That’s to Leon in a Tucson federal prison.

If you’re listening, tell them what you’re viewing,

how his son said, “I ain’t seen my pops in over 20 years”

That’s ‘cause the last east coast prison he was in, he got his face blew in.

What you doing, nigga? Using his life for street credibility

Did they open faces and I don't want to open cases,

nigga that ain’t you.

And you do this only when it benefits him.

The other times when he rhymes about that shit,

he’s playing solely the victim.

I know you convinced them,

but I came to expose your wisdom, nigga.

I got a cousin doing 25 years to life for murder,

a daddy who sell dope for a living.

But (stumble)those their commitments,

what that got to do with me?

I sold my weed, I fought all of my own fights.

Oh, moved some coke, I pitched in, that’s just it.

Conscious brother, street nigga,

I’ve been in both positions and know the difference,

enough for holmes who’s listening

to my storyline, I don’t glorify, I report it wise,

told the ending.

CHARLIE CLIPS
They want me to talk about my pops’ case again?

How you told Calicoe when you battled him

that he ain’t have half the batter?

Last time I told Rex, my moms was the gangster in my family,

so the shit about my pops don’t really matter.

See, the problem is, he fucks up y’all mind

Yo on some G shit, I’ve never been a bitch nigga.

All my raps, I’ma get through.

Y’all want to call my pops a rat? Your pops is a snitch, too.

You bitch ass nigga, and you know what, I ain’t lying shit,

I even keep it a hundred.

Your father snitched but he told a psychiatrist.

Oh, you didn’t know that was going on,

but you got a nigga in your section that’s flowing strong.

Tell that nigga shut the fuck up when I’m rapping

if he don’t know what’s going on.

What happened? My father is the snitch?

Why I’m not the one that’s looking mad?

These niggas double team me for what,

just to come up here and talk about my dad?

You pussy, these niggas rob Mook for his coat, not you.

That’s what make me mad.

Look at this nigga acting like a fag.

If it ain’t true, tell them why he met him talking about his dad?

You know what’s funny about this though,

I’ma tell you the rest. His father is a snitch too.

At the end of the day, I’ve never been jumped,

I’ve never been punched in my face or robbed.

He talking about my father,

now y’all want to say boo and scream fuck Clips?

Oh I see what’s going on.

A bunch of y’all is Loaded on Lux dick,

but we gon’ get to the rest of this shit.

My moms and my grandmother was the gangsters in my family,

so I just want y’all to imagine that.

That was a great round you did,

but exposing something about my pops is not battle rap,

but this is:

A certain battle rapper called my phone and said,

“we should double team Lux”

and I laughed like “nigga, say word”

Now y’all know I’m predictable, right?

So guess which battle rapper it was?

The nigga Aye Verb.

The nigga Verb called my phone and said

“what’s up, Charlie? I heard you’re going against Lux,

so I’ma need you to be lyrical.

Borrow my Showtime, bring three rounds if you can.

I don’t want you on stage looking pitiful.

Read the Bible a hundred times,

‘cause that boy known to get biblical.”

And I’m looking at the phone the whole time like

“nigga, what you forgot what I did to you?”

(This is true story.)

Every time I take a battle serious, my opponent dies,

come back to life, and then they try again.

It’s like I’m Ghost Rider, Smack the devil,

he raise their soul, I make ‘em fry again.

You Lux in the spiritual and you Rex in the spiritual.

Charlie-Clips-vs.-Loaded-Lux-lyrics-Charlie
It’s time to die again.

Kylie Jenner, close your eyes, ‘cause I’ma

expose this gay tiger in this lion’s den.

That’s the name of your league, right nigga?

Your baby moms fronted you the money,

you was broke, ain’t have a set price.

You was on a low carb diet,

no wonder you ain’t have your bread right.

Ironic you’re on URL bragging,

but your league couldn’t afford a website.

You wasn’t even gonna drop my footage,

I would’ve never came out if it wasn’t for Head Ice.

But I can’t salute Ice just yet,

that’s my homie but that nigga there is deceiving.

They’re both on Eighth, that mean they’re liars,

that’s why nobody believe ‘em.

What you coming at Ice for?

‘Cause he dissed me in a interview for no reason.

So why show Wolf love

if Love left the Wolves for Cleveland?

Charlie Clips being pussy? C’mon y’all, imagine that.

You broke down my father past,

but what the fuck does that got to do with battle rap?

You know what, let me get back to this,

‘cause truth be told, I still fuck with Ice

He set Lux up for me like “kill ‘em Beloved,

you’re too fucking nice.”

You wore that Money Mitch outfit against Mook.

At first, I was confused, it had me fucking tight.

But now I remembered in Paid In Full,

Money Mitch was set up by Uncle Ice.

You see how God put this together, Beloved,

‘cause ever since Lionz Den,

you prepared like you ain’t hear the kid.

Your side bitch pregnant, your wifey home,

translation: that means you fear the kid.

You watched me try angles on Roc,

that’s a pyramid.

You slept on me and woke up in a funeral,

we’re in Phara crib.

Hollow broke this nigga’s style down.

I can’t lie, the nigga Mook amaze me.

They both broke down how you say a bunch of nothing.

But y’all be going super crazy.

It’s like the building look good on the outside,

but the inside is nasty because the super lazy.

Russell Wilson, let’s say I see errors in your future, baby.

And I’ma break one down for y’all,

‘cause the nigga AZ got a song featuring Nas.

And the song is called “Everything Is Everything”,

and what do y’all know to my surprise

The nigga Nas said a line, he said

“death before dishonor, that’s something we should practice,

And don’t play with love ‘cause love is evil spelled backwards.”

Wait a goddamn minute, Beloved, you turn love into live

and incorporated that in your schemes

so they could scream; you went to sleep listening to Nas,

woke up and stole his dream?

You got a picture with AZ on your Instagram,

be a fan, not a fiend

Look at me king,

stop stealing all your best lyrics from out of Queens.

This is exactly what I mean, “is it evil to live backwards”,

I don’t know, but that shit was flame, my nigga.

But love, live, life back-, that shit is all the same, my nigga

You want to go backwards? I got y’all.

No lie, Hitman, I remember them

cold nights that I was blessed.

Two Eagles, thinking about putting these

Deserts in his mouth ‘cause I was stressed.

I said I want to show him where this Beretta is,

peep how I dog God and his relatives

Putting them in Hell in the same place that the devil lived.

For anybody in the crowd that go to church,

I apologize for saying the word “devil”.

But no matter how you flip the shit,

this nigga is not on my level.

I ain’t nothing backwards about Charlie,

especially the way that I grip up.

He’s my student, and

I got to help my pupils when they slip up.

I got the mind of a Martin Luther,

look at me king, you should be proud of me.

And I shall overcome

on your girl lips while she’s mouthing me.

I had a dream that

all these people in the front row was coming out for me.

And how ironic,

they’re watching me lose my mind from the balcony.

Fuck a coin flip, I’ll be first to let it pop.

This footage? Like my left hand: worth a second watch.

That’s two-timing if you don’t follow. Kill ‘em all — nobodies to role models,

you don’t gotta do numbers to see the hands like Movado.

You know I’ma tell him how it is, and then I’ma show ya.

Just to back up my point like Dellavedova.

I’m a machine. You ain’t think shit could get any colder?

I’ll dump a can if he press my buttons. Get him a soda.

Bitch I met every quota. Gave proof that I’m Jesus(spanish prounciation).

Always brought the most weight to home plate, boy I’m Babe Ruth.

Since he Italian and I’m greek, they place us in the same group,

but I was raised Lebanese: always stuck to my Bay roots (Beirut).

It’s true, I’m Isaac Mendez: that pen stroke deadly.

Mariah Carey: you ain’t think it would get so heavy.

I got that fresh toast ready for him and Miss Coletti,

like I’m bout to be the best man at Fresco’s wedding.

If you squeamish, y’all should turn away your heads,

‘cause Papa Shango’s back here with a curse to raise the dead.

Once you work away your debts, I’ll be first to take his bread,

tell him break off that paper like a perforated edge.

I’m a loan shark, no sarcasm.

You’ll need sonar tracking ‘cause I’m so far past him.

I’m composing Mozart classics, so don’t start acting

like we in the same boat; I’m the coast guard captain.

What happened though? I thought that you was going places.

Must have had a change of heart like Smokin’ Aces.

Shit I don’t even believe in when he say what race he is,

‘cause these facial features say Enrique Iglesias.

But that there? That ain’t even a racial bar actually,

it’s more alluding to why we think you’re a mark, Anthony.

So stop posting about being a men’s rights activist,

or you ain’t welcome back in the Westside after this.

FRESCO
I give a fuck about the battle rap trivia and how much ammo you got.

You can’t rap the way I’m rapping if you haven’t been shot.

But until I get a signed letter from Tupac where he asks me to stop,

I’ma keep pulling this shit like I’m practicing slots.

See I don’t battle a lot, but if the conditions just right, I’m completely airing,

and you might be rolling with Organik, to a decent area,

til his expression goes blank (“Round One”), like he’s the narrator,

and I pop up for the scrap like a secret character.

Flawless what I call this, all I took is a Vick.

Rubber butt up on the rifle just to cushion the kick.

Let the hollow points blossom so the bullets’ll stick.

It’s like I’m playing Minecraft how I’m cooking a brick.

If I get the slightest urge, I’ma look up his chick

so I can send her all the pictures that I took of my dick.

The-Saurus-vs-Fresco-lyrics-fr
I’m back on my bullshit, and doing it Big League.

I put his IV(ivy) on the wall ‘cause I grew up at Wrigley.

I leave his trap with chicken scratch like I drew him a squiggly;

I draw different, so there ain’t no way you’re doodling with me.

Family man. They gon have to plan his funeral quickly.

Get your dome split. The whole kit ’n caboodle is with me.

Either the chopper’ll take his wig like he boozing with Britney,

or he get sliced under his ribs like I’m removing a kidney.

I got the kinda bars that you have to give a kidney for.

People bite and try to bait me into something like a fishing lure.

Team full of animals: Starfox 64;

for the cabbage, I’ll spray something Sauvage, it’s not Chris Dior.

Daddy should’ve taught me better. Momma should’ve kissed me more.

Trump Tower of terror, tell your daughter it’s a Disney tour.

People on the ground’ll see her body falling fifty floors.

Even Ripley swore he never seen some shit like this before.

So after I Clapton your kid, you’ll get clapped in the rib.

The way my finger licking shots, he need a napkin and bib.

You’ll get twisted off the top; I will Snapple your lid.

If you actually live, you’ll have something to tell people

and fun facts you can give, like,

did you know that Fresco will push your line back and then raffle your wig,

and let blood cover the wall like The Faculty did?

Pulp Fiction: your girl O.D.ing off of the swag that I give,

and she gon need a chest shot after we crash at the crib.

You should be viral on YouTube. The chicken pox guy.

With a face that’s made from scratch like a chicken pot pie.

Bars easy to catch like you hit a pop fly,

got you looking stupid like your daddy when he didn’t drop by.

Bars clip the whole row behind you, but you gon catch the brunt of it.

Not even the Asian dude from Tianenman Square could stand in front of this.

I’ll make your bitch’s jaw drop, and if she withstand the punishment,

I’ll make her keep that mouth open so I can ash the blunt in it.

Round Two
THE SAURUS
There ain’t a chance that he can win today. The Bay’s what made a man of me.

Homie, I’m on my Mophie shit: this case could change to battery.

This isn’t anger management, it’s pain and agony.

I’ll kill him, take the stand and get away with it: I’ll Casey Anthony.

Okay, children. He’ll get coached on stage, that’s Craig Nelson.

At our peaks, this is Mount Saint Helen’s to cave dwelling.

Go ahead, click in your seat belt. It ain’t helping,

‘cause that hook’ll make him spin in his chair; he Blake Shelton.

They tell me toe-tagging Fresco won’t happen, ever,

but I’ll take flight, masked up: low cabin pressure.

See his pen’s fire, but sometimes it don’t match his efforts,

so the way he raps is playing catch: he just throws that together.

Never risk-taking, but he must admit, what I did changed him,

‘cause my shit gave him a foundation, I’m brick-laying.

So the more you see this Chris Angel illusion of clips waving,

the more you bout to see money get pressed like inflation.

They been saying I’ll automatically lose if I use gay jokes on him.

But I wouldn’t do that in the Bay so it ain’t no problem,

I don’t need ‘em. Each ‘bow leave him with no feeling,

no coke fiending, just dope lines, I’m O.D.ing.

Ain’t no type of that powder, it’s just firing power;

I’m bout to Flash on him: 88 miles per hour.

The-Saurus-vs-Fresco-lyrics
Even when he’s home, his bitch likes when I pound her;

she hop on it down the street like a wireless router.

You been spiraling downward; it wasn’t a mistake.

So keep bumping them gums, I’ll uppercut you in the face.

Some’ll say I wouldn’t win this if it wasn’t in the Bay,

but you’d get Trumped in every state, no republican debate.

FRESCO
You gave birth to off-point comparisons disguised as hard punches,

like, “ho ho, that’s why your heart’s pumping,

‘cause you look like Michael Clark Duncan with his private parts shrunken.”

But my homie with the shit, so if you try to spark something,

he got that Nickelodeon magazine, that means Slime’ll start dumping.

He said, “people think my left is made of metal plated armor..”

I stopped the battle right there and I never made it farther.

He probably said,

“you’re fuckin up the feng shui, you should’ve decorated smarter.

This is not the fade you wanted; I’m your second favorite barber.

See, you just wanna pop a bottle like a celebration starter,

but they’re looking at you funny like an elevator farter.”

It’s lines like that that’ll probably get you relegated, partner,

in your PoRich bag at Ground Zero on a detonation marker.

Now that’s a tiny sample, but a prime example.

You gotta know when to walk away, it’s no time to gamble.

Bum ass flow. Fuck you and anybody taking it,

I been using gun lines since Grind Time when everybody hated it.

He was like,

“all these wack emcees rapping about guns are just as fake as ever.

At least I can frame it better and give a more creative effort;

I can use gun bars and stress the syllables to make it clever,

‘cause he’s known for keeping something tucked like Kaitlyn Jenner.”

You need to take your notebooks and throw ‘em all into a paper shredder.

This shit has been a long time coming; it’s better late than never.

I hardly spend time with my bars, ‘cause I don’t take forever.

Plus I’m stuck in a teenage wasteland

like the Staples Center when the Lakers enter.

Now I’m out for blood; that’s why you losing a liter.

I took my cue(Q) from Doctor Mundo how I threw you a cleaver.

He was in a acting troupe, doing musical theatre,

while I was in a Aston coupe playing musical sweepers.

He say I’m nice. But the feeling isn’t mutual, Peter.

After the last album, Chase Moore don’t want nothing to do with you neither,

I mean, Madness hasn’t called you since you blew up his beeper.

It’s 2015. Your man Greg still ain’t threw you a feature.

He’s known your ass for 20 years and still don’t have a song with you,

so that’s a strong signal that your fans have all dwindled.

Y’all could’ve done a rap-along single for the Amazon Kindle

and had the nursing home turn’t before your grandma called bingo.

You must’ve scratched the wrong pimples, and you have some soft dimples,

so you ugly and soft, I guess the path you on fits you.

I could switch magazines like I grabbed the wrong issue

or leave him crushed in the grill of the black Range like a mastodon hit you.

They say TheSaurus is robbing the cradle. Let’s get to chopping this fable.

I say, keep that shit up for as long as you’re able.

He’s like a card shark sitting at the softest of tables,

trying to lure a sucker in with the comedy angle.

But I wonder what’ll happen when his daughter gets playful:

40 year old man with a little girl you thought was your angel,

in a fully loaded Jag with all the options enabled,

pulling that bitch’s hair back like she wanted a facial.

He’ll probably tell her that he love her and he’s honest and faithful,

but all he want is a quick plug like an optical cable.

So now you’re up at night, looking at the locket she gave you,

‘cause a lonely dad’s the only man that your daughter relates to.

Round Three
THE SAURUS
I ain’t come to joke around. You know this clown’s been broken down,

and for my local crowd, this is how a closing round’s supposed to sound.

Now watch this, it’s all biz. He don’t know what a cross is

til I drop one on him like a drawbridge.

Shoulda saw this coming. Me punchlining with you?

It’s about be more one-sided than Unbias Review.

You won’t deny that it’s true, just ‘cause i won’t pass the torch;

I’m Bo Jackson: belong in my own class of sport.

I’ll kill him on cam, but it won’t stand in court,

so why go back and forth? Just toe-tag the corpse.

You got no chance. I’ll beat you in your own dang arena.

Charge it to the game? Nope, won’t take his VISA.

You want to throw? I’ll go straight to home plate and greet ya,

I been flipping off the bat, San Jose Bautista.

It don’t take a genius to see your business is foreclosed.

Message delivered in morse code, this is a war zone.

I know you straight, but how you dress? I’ve seen bitches in your clothes.

It’s like you shop in Narnia: you lyin’ which is your wardrobe.

This is more close to a dissection. Try testing,

I’ll right, left, him, then shortcut like Swype texting.

Your time’s ending. Walk over you high-stepping,

headshot make his whole thoughts changes like a life lesson.

Now I’m guessing there’s a reason that you reference ratchets.

Even though you showed up dressed like that chick.

Trying to appeal to two demographics like Lenny Kravitz,

but it’s just theatrics. There’s nothing upstairs but an empty attic.

I will dead this cat, head in a bag like any match they offer.

This was just a short stop in the Bay: I’m Brandon Crawford.

Ain’t no cannon fodder, this cat is softer than behind the candelabra,

now watch your life get cancelled like the time I battled Hoffa.

Two-time champ, I’ll win it two times more,

now I’m back on top of the game like a new high score.

FRESCO
You blew up when battles had DJs, but can’t rap to a beat.

That’s like a professional breakdancer that can’t move his feet.

Ugly dude with freestyles. They’re like, “that dude is heat,”

but this was a written battle filmed in HD, which is bad news for Pete.

And my lines’ll be the only lines they quote from it,

so this won’t be a battle where the fans can say we both stunted.

I roll something, pass it to your girl, now she’s so blunted.

She gon give me a little face like the old hundreds.

Red, white, and green diamonds like Italian ice.

Shorty’s so wet on the phone, she need a bag of rice.

You ain’t been popping for a while like a can of Slice.

Seasoned fans took me so they booked me for the added spice.

Now I ain’t even want to use this bar for Pete,

but he lives in the desert, so he should be used to all this heat;

so from Cancun to a sand dune, I roll up on dude and park the jeep,

ready to dump the cans at his buggy like it’s Supermarket Sweep.

I could wake his block up, or let the tech ring silent.

Baby boy, I’m pro-choice, but fuck your left wing bias.

Now that was a check swing. But this next thing’s violent;

I’m bout to open up on him like a X-Wing pilot.

My connect always good; I got extra bandwidth,

and a second plan for anything the weapons can’t fix.

I got money changing hands like Megaman’s fist;

the watch got a second hand; you got a secondhand wrist.

He bout to face another blemish. This the worst you get sweeped,

ashes get swept under the rug like it hurts to give grief.

Supersoaker backpack, squirt the kid brief,

plus they love me in the hood like the first and fifteenth.

I be at the same health club where his chick belong.

She catching pheromones from me at the liptithon.

Yoga mat down, let her suck me like a twisty straw

while she whip her hair back and forth like Dixie Kong.

I’ll take her to the second gym like Misty gone,

and make a movie that star me(Starmie), that’s not Digimon.

No a cappella group, but he gon know what kinda shit we on

when he hear that oowop going just like a 50’s song.

No GPS tracking, but I’m getting Pete traced.

They’ll have to set up a perimeter, and get police tape.

That mean I’ll chalk this boy out. He want to get a clean slate;

I’ll cook him a couple minutes at a time like a Kid Cuisine plate.

I’ll go into black ops mode; now I’m in his team base,

he will not see zombies, but I’ll get his team chased.

Warhammer, forty k’s without the figurine paint,

he get ratchet after ratchet like he did a speed date.

Lieutenant warp nine, put him into deep space

and pitch a bird out the whip like they did in Speed Race.

18 karats on the wrist, with the wintergreen face

and just looking at it giving you that Listerine taste.

For trying to get a buzz off my shit, get you smacked with a flyswatter.

I stay splashing his bitch like she rafting through whitewater.

Back in school, I had the tool in the back of my guy’s locker.

County jail, a young boy got put in a pod like Anakin Skywalker.

He don’t need breaking news to see action from live choppers.

For me it always on sight; even scrapped with my eye doctor.

His bitch on my album cover,

Alex Summers from all the Havoc that I’ve caused her,

but I’ve been through that bitch’s walls so many times

that I’m actually Nightcrawler.

I’m pissed off at people even thinking the match was even.

I mean I should Rerun my rounds cause this is a classic beating.

I’m like Popeye the sailor: I’m gripping a can and squeezing.

Talking out the side of your mouth gon get you the Bambi treatment.

I brought the Thumper in the club. Now it’s switching to rabbit season:

if he Bugs, I’ll get him smoked like Yosemite Sam was creeping.

Morris’ll catch a flashback like he’s sitting in class and dreaming,

while I’m at his bae side, high, like Tiffani-Amber Thiessen.

Mario Lopez is in the building. This is your chance to meet him.

The silencer is Andy Griff how it’s whistling back to greet him.

This is Aladdin dreaming, I’m wishing we had a reason.

I just had to get a couple bands off him before giving him back his freedom.You been in God mode? fuck that, this nigga just tryna seem hard

I'll bring four in (foreign) pussy back like he tryna get a green card!

These bars? Forget it, in my waist is where the banger looms

Y'all seen how I trained X man, now I'm in Danja room?

The pain consumes, but I'm back with several enhancements

The .40 take out his ribs 'cause this Maryland man sinned (Marilyn Manson)!

When yall hear them, it be a bunch of filler, see these niggaz playin'

I throw sharp rounds off the gate like Ninja Gaiden!

You got beef in yo heart? Well bitch nigga you not alone

We move in on 'em with no agreement... that's a squatter home!

I'm a rider Zone, I'll find out where you be at and yo position homie

I do this, by having niggaz tail (tell) you like they snitchin' on me!

The Smith is on me, you see in 2 years what I've accomplished?

Being from the west and killing the east is what I encompass!

I don't know where my mind went, I just know I'll commit the crime tense

All because of small words I promise they'll never find prints!

Before you would begin a verse, you used to have dinner first

Then 3 battles later that gypsy hit you with the thinner curse

Face a winner first, nigga you done ran into a freight train

It takes a big dog to show you you ain't great Dain/Dane!

The 8 bang, I'll catch em with his bitch, I'll let the kids observe

2 shots...they sink next to each other like "His" and "Hers"!

This the word, you yo brother's keeper even through bloodshed

Well look at yo career, and look at yo brothers....nuff said!

A year ago, I was liable to send shells

But nowadays beef with me entails...

A coat hanger through ya stomach draggin out ya entrails

Then flying a jet over ya house releasing a cloud of Chem trails!

We got a problem please don't let me get near trey

I'll blow off a nigga ear and tongue over hearsay!

If I flash it, I might as well kill you, I'm puttin lead in ya face

Cause even if I'm missing you I'm still catching a case!

The beef is back, the heat'll clap til his meat detach

Choke em from behind with a shoe lace...

That's the sneak attack!

Danja-Zone-vs.-Danny-lyrics-3
I keep a strap, with these sub machines we ain't bogus
That extended gives us 70...to ours (72 hrs) like a 3 day notice! BarGod!

Bitch I really hustle, I move zones, I've earned my splendor

We from the same the crew, but right now I gotta burn a member

Nigga God sent you here

But I was taught when you receive unsolicited mail you return to sender!

Remember, these young niggaz can't rap with me

Cause I'm bout to turn 36 Zone...that's the key (ki)!

I shoot up ya house, ya innocent mother be in a blood pool

Bullets be crackin the walls like a drug mule!

Wait...Crack in the walls? Drug mule? It's hopeless you rookie

When you behind these bars you better have something dope in you pussy!

And even though he already on the ground with this shit

This wack MC got another 2 rounds of this shit, yikes!

DANJA ZONE
The Messiah of metaphors, the Sultan of similes,

They ain’t seen a dickhead get washed since shorty said “The royal penis is clean your highness!”

See I write dis, for da pride and glory,

You might wanna leave me alone, dat’z not a threat, dat’z a promise, sorry,

You know? Like a lending signed agreement?

As far as lines, explaining Montessori niggaz, iz a different kinda teaching

I pull a gun while he holdin a celly to his temple

I'll shoot him while he holdin his Samsung

Fragments of it go in his wrist, I embed the Note in his arm like Momento!

I am mental! I run in his house with no kinda patience

It'll be my pleasure to tie this nigga up like a Dominatrix!

This my time of greatness, first I focus

My pen is crazy, the flow is clean like Reverse Osmosis! BarGod!

I'll spread out pieces of you, after I chop you with a sword til you die

Your dependents will only know where a fourth of you lie!

Ya sources were right, I did say fuck My Brother's Keeper

Ima fuck yo bitch and when I'm done I'll let my brother keep her!

The snub'll reach ya, I'll walk up on you and fire 3 shots

Thank the Lord he don't got another round of this shit, yikes!

DANJA ZONE
On the 7th day, God rested, think about that…cuz I really want ya’ll to hear me out,

Cuz if you susceptible to sleepin, you susceptible to dreamin,

So tell me…what you think Gods have nightmares about?

Now if you even think you know, I want you to answer me then,

And if you don’t it’s cool, but in a minute, I’ma ask you again,

For now, I’m back in attack mode,

Some asshole, said I look like dude from Martin, which is factz though,

Should recognize the KING in the middle, of speakin in riddles,

Yea nigga, I’m Nat Cole!

Act bold, da gauge’ll lift him,

Fried a grape, a month later, Danja back in California raisin niggaz!

Errythang I say is vicious, my nina clap wit no legs,

But my Dame kicks, like I’m bringin back da Pro Keds,

You ain’t better than Ooops, Day, J, Magic, Jones, Ced,

Dat’z Nitty, Kannon, 4-0, Trez,

You in da, lineup so far down, we can’t see you like B. Magic’s fo’head

Dat’z why we did dis in ya city,

And he still defenseless against me!

But since we, gon begin there nucka,

It's apparent I been killin…I’ll make ya men end EZ like a Menendez brova

You faggot you,

Not street enough for this avenue,

Gut punches, hand ova his stomach,

Losin is absolute!

To rap wit you, is overkill,

Give him a can it could show who real,

Wantin wreck, A broken grill’ll give him dat total feel,

Thinkin bein hood, in genetics, dese punchez’ll fuck up a nigga motor skills

No forreal, won’t switch, I’ma use da same,

Fist, a contusion came,

Then I’ma bring it back like a boomerang,

Bruise him, da abuse and pain,’ll look like he tried, to kiss da side, of a moving train!

Fuck who you paid, I can’t control ya money,

But dat alone shows, you can’t compare ya lil hungry, to 3rd world country,

Trust me, my hunger been, from 1 to 10, a hunnid den,

They think I suck my stomach in,

They can’t grasp the barz, I get across, I punch within, a jungle gym

Try to write, like I write, you might, just lose a fuckin limb,

It’s tough findin, Blood Diamonds, so some content, with Jungle Gems

Kids, you got a bunch of dem,

Don’t wanna see them? Keep mugging den,

A dome shot’ll make it hard to thank, and wonder when,

Any nigga dat stare’ll (sterile), draw a blank, can’t fuckin' leave or see their son (seed a son) again

I'm gunnin dem, I mean what else is there to talk about?

Knew we'd meet, he'd freeze up before cooking, maybe you shoulda thought (thawed) this out

If there was even a slight chance of doubt

So let me ask you again what do Gods have nightmares about?

The answer is terrorist attacks if I'm not mistaken

For a rack (Iraq) he fucked, Danja's code name Saddam-a natrix

So for the sake of conversation, why would you bring the BarGod to the spawn of Satan

The abomination, next time you contemplating on that line don't ever cross that

And before you even mention a nigga, say where your bars at?

Off with his head, make some noise!For those that don’t really know me, Tony’s the name.

I been here since the beginning

when we coined this place the O-Zone, holdin the flame.

Shit I just turned thirty three.

And for me I feel like I’m gettin too old for this game,

it’s like age... and rap...

wait, motherfucker ain’t you like forty and change?

Shit, bro, you like Head I.C.E age. Or the Ice Age.

Your fucking kids? ...My age.

But actin like you tough when I coulda just handled Quantum Physics.

And you're Puerto Rican, so I know your blood type is Honda Civic.

Your broad all on my didick until it explode like a bomb is in it;

if it's beef I put my fist all through this pussy like an obstetrician.

But he type nice sometimes.

So if you wanted to doubt him, yo you couldn't.

But it's no Secret, PH is pretty balanced, for a woman.

But I'm connected everywhere I go like an unlimited data plan.

You're a Zero, so you can scream 'til

you're blue in the face like Megaman.

Or I come strapped with that Machete like Trejo, Dan,

and put that blade through your fuckin' fade like a Raiders fan.

In jail? You-PC, that bar cold (barcode), get checked out when the laser scan.

With that pipe spittin fire, like I'm playing jazz flute in Anchorman.

PH
Just to set it off, in this battle shit, I'm a analyst.

Bars crafted with the same Dizaster-ous

patterns that conquered Canibus.

No forty pages, but for damn near forty years,

I been the man 'n shit,

so too bad if you mad

for what I'm about to do to this Madness kid.

Bow to your sensei.

From 20 paces, I put your light out like a candlewick.

I saw your girl's body. She's what I call a magic trick.

She's about my bars and balls — that's a abacus;

I don't push a Acura Legend,

but they say I'm a Legend, and that's Ac-urate.

You're an MC that part times as a comedian just for battlin',

who takes more back shots than slave sadomasochists

do from master's whip.

Man up Madness, before I massacre who you mashin' with,

that goes for Joe Cutter, Dirtbag Dan, and yea,

Frank Stacks is a bitch.

Your Cali crew will pull a switcheroo and get rid 'a you.

It's Common Sense,

your Westside Connection will see the bitch in you.

I'm not one of you jokey ass rappers. I hope you ain't mistook me.

You think you a Battle Cat, well if that's the fact,

well I'm He-Man. Cuz I'm used to riding on you big pussies.

He thought I was gonna creep solo, in a Jeep dolo,

but I came with three cholos.

One look like Madd Illz, the other two

look like Jonny Storm and Jee Polo.

They gon catch Tone on the corner, like an off the hook payphone.

Break bones on bums, you know, out of place, holmes,

I got a crazy ratchet, and when I model her,

shit'll get ugly like Grace Jones.

Round 2
MADNESS
You owe me a hundred dollars,

cuz I bet Frank Stacks you wouldn't choke against PoRichard.

And you such a dyke homo,

every time you play ro-sham-bo, you only throw scissors.

Yo, welcome to Orlando you giant Puerto Rican easter egg.

Shit compared to you, Tone is fly, my dick's Cobra Ky,

why? Cuz it sweep the leg.

I should let a chainsaw rape your face

like a scene from the Evil Dead.

decapitated so everyone on I-4 can see your head,

hangin where there used to be the sign for Merita bread.

(What up my people??)

See everybody here know me, Tony G.,

up a couple drinks, I'm like the O-Zone Ol'D.B.

And if this faggot got a issue I'ma straighten him out like I got OCD.

You old as shit. Probably making muffins or a baker's dozen

but you ain't fuckin with my bread.

This old man probably all... out of breath...

from the thoughts running through his head.

Chillin at his mom's rest,

talking to kids about battling's infinite conquests,

but always stops to yell, "Get off my lawn!"

but he still lives in the projects.

You graduated with Tito Puente.

And got your yearbook signed by Don Francisco.

Plus you were watching Sabado Gigante...

when it was Sabado Chiquito.

I pull the small heart out of this Decep' like the All-Spark.

How are you unique

when you look like every fuckin Puerto Rican at BVL Wal-Mart?

But I grew up around Boricuas and I love em to death

so just play along, y'all, it's all part of the gag.

Actin like you hard,

son your crew got one less star than your flag.

PH
He gets his material from 1980s comedy movies. Way to be original.

So he gets Big, this Naked Gun'll have you Trading Places,

I'm not kidding you.

Torso in the basement. Neck and face in the living room,

you'll catch 9 irons out that Caddyshack,

if you go for Easy Money, I'm killing you.

He moved to Cali, and left his partner in rhyme in Florida,

that was Critical;

your bars vers' High Collide was cheap vodka,

that's when you hit your Pinnacle.

I'll front like I'm giving you dap and start shivving you,

cut puzzle pieces out your face like Mystikal

album cover for Unpredictable,

damn, I'm nice, I put words and phrases into a centrifuge,

you rap jokes, buddy, my bars 'll put an end to you;

stomp you in the ground till smoke and sparks travel into you,

and there's a crater under your body

like a Terminator was sent for you.

It's about to Rain in Southern California;

I'll kill all your phoney homies,

and split you in three, so all we'll see is Tony, Toni, Toné.

I'm a pimp though, got your limp hoe by her pisshole,

have her shouting out more than a Carter Deems intro.

The South a movement. You could've been on,

but you traded yourself to the West and your buzz got piss warm.

Then he Lurch back, hopin' they add 'im(Addam)

to the Family, but the love, Cousin, It's gone,

your last name is Gomez so it's only right you kiss arms.

Round 3
MADNESS
See I can't even go hard on PH.

Cuz that's my homie and he type cool.

I got all my references from 80s movies.

They came out when you were in high school.

If I rapped like you, I would rape myself.

It's like your style is fractured pieces of something.

It's a decent assumption that we're not impressed with raps that

sound like fuckin Ikea instructions.

(But he's "Big", uh, I could do that. Yo.)

I got that Foot-long on him, so don't try to be a Hero(gyro).

I go for broke like I'm Po', Boy, a Grinder with this Torpedo.

Your girl? I'ma Bomb'er, cuz I'm a Engineer with the Zingers.

As soon as we Meet-balls, and I had my salami

all in that chicken fingers.

For real. What the fuck, I gotta put it in subtitles?

Foot-long, gyro, po' boy...

Motherfucker I just killed you with Sub titles.

But I ain't wanna do you like this.

Cuz he my boy, but hey, he ain't got him a choice.

Your parents regret having you... because they wanted a boy.

In battle rap, your name is "ehh" cuz he the ultimate dicksucker.

You were gonna battle Getcha..

but you look like fuckin Getcha's big brother.

(And I stole that line from him outside motherfucker!)

PH
What's poppin, Tone? You not spittin proper, Tone.

You're a Columbian who thinks he's Italian.

You wouldn't be a Soprano, even if you sang opera, Tone.

You put three albums out, only one person would cop it, Tone.

Stop it, Tone, I'm a monster that'll pop ya

and tan ya til you're coppertone.

You're not fire, bitch, you're a snitch. A copper, Tone.

The real Tone from Florida is Deff,

your voice? Ehh. You're not even the proper Tone.

Why you even here though? KOTD stop calling you bro?

Tried rapping serious for once and

the math you added actually got you subtracted by Uno?

You self-hating race traitor.

Leading a double life like there's two Tones,

brown on the outside, white on the inside... nigga you two-tone.

He done shit out here

to make y'all laugh for cash like Silent Libary.

But he moved to Cali, cuz that's where he can

come out the closet and keep all his silent lies buried.

I pray to the lord, cuz you a non-believer,

so I'm like "Yo, I know he wrong,

he traded a chance Peek-at-chu just to Poke-a-mon."

What'chall want, a champion that'll use the belt to bring order,

or a joker that'd use it as a gag gift that shoots water?

You want the resurrection led by a man

that never turned his cheek on a brand,

or a nigga that at the first signs of adversity

he travels to another land and turns his back on the fans?Take over, the break's over, wigger

God emcee, lee, straight yola

No shake no baking soda dispose of ya lame doja

I can't wait to light up this square nigga chain smoker

So this the new dude they pushing trying to get him views

I'll get him chewed with one bar in a round, letter Q

You let him loose to let him lose, think he's on my level

You're the 40 Year Old Virgin, you're putting this pussy on a pedestal

You're getting screwed if I shoot...sex pistol

You better have arms coming out of arms, yep, Vishnu

That's a Hindu reference but I'll get back to that

Let's return to the surface of this soul book I've read into

Your name is Jed Mitchell, know what rhymes with Jed Mitchell

Ness hit you, neck issues

Tecs, pistols, kick you in your leg, trip you

Dead, crippled, nigga you have the swagger of wet tissue

Let's be honest... You a awkward white nigga b

With these little depressed gothic-like tendencies

He's Walter White in his schemes, but real life

He walks by I wanna stomp some life into him till my conscious side intervenes

True or false, Blackout 3 the second time Drake came

All the rappers got to Toronto the same day

Met in front of the telly we took pictures and exchanged names

I leave to go to my room and see you in a strange place

Tucked away safe in the lobby with this ashamed face

I say hey, shake hands wave and say g'day mate

I slept a few hours woke up at 8:00, I shaved, ate

Made my way back downstairs and you was still in the same place

Me and my nigga Harsh had coerced some girls to come get us

Diz already had some birds with him set up

Everybody had a flame from dimes to sloppy in between

But if you pulled anything you shoulda learned to stretch better

Boy I'm absurd with every word I get better

With every verb I'm trying to curb my furthest personal measure

And you never heard a more clever verse from a bird of my feather

So yeah I was irked I couldn't remember my words against Sevah

That just means I gotta take it out on this nerd bird

He gone learn or earn him an urn or permanent stretcher

Shoot'em a curve he'll serve as the catcher

When I Toledo panic button him and we ain't even working together

SOUL
I'm just gonna keep it real, to me you're one of the dopest rappers that made it through

Wordplay and cadence too... it's nothing but love... I can only say what's true

But what the fuck were you thinking when you said you're "crazier than crazy glue"

Oh... ain't that you?

Oh Ness Lee... Then forget the first 2 bars... he's wack and I hate this dude

Dopest in the south you ain't that fuckin' hard mate

And no way you're Elliot Ness, cause in his career, he managed to catch up to Scarface

Think about it… dopest in the south… not on my watch

I was on Limewire in '08 freestylin to "My Block"

Plus Young Jeezy, Kriss Kross, Andre, T.I, Jon

You need to revisit your status like Timehop

And those are just some names that are colder from the A

Fuck the dopest in the south, you ain't the dopest in your state

It's a white lie, a myth, how's my guy the king

When his tracks get sonned by CyHi The Prynce

Other people carry your state, the truth's out liar

I ring bells I'm the new town crier

Your state's like his new house when you blew out your cookout fryer

Cause you both rely on other people to put out fire

Fucking crawling on the floor tryna escape through the catflap

Scared to breathe around the air he in (Aryan) like Anne Frank

Rep faded, that's that, get traded, Nasdaq

So much heat in the pad, he having flashbacks

Scratch that, insurance scam man had the last laugh

Now it's hand bags, glad rags, flash jags, cracked crab

Gabbana man bags, Tax bracket half capped

He survived the fire, we saw through it like Mad Max

Fucking piece of shit, scamming rap music, for p's and shit

But he got Karma in the form of a scheming bitch that cheats on him

Now that ain't something she'll admit, but how do you not see the hints

It plays "how could you be so heartless" when her beeper rings

On Fridays, it's night babe, kiss him on the cheek and dip

She out all night fucking Heartless and swinging from Conceited's dick

I blame The Saurus, she ain't beat him since Peter did

He ain't seen the chick he sleeping since that Grecian myth like Oedipus

Round 2
NESS LEE
I said I'll smack your dumb ass

Your girl shorter than Sonny

If I was a pedophile I'd snatch her young ass

This weirdo pretty much admitted that Loe Pesci created his style

That'd be great if I hadn't already made him my child

So if I kilt the guy that made you this may take you a while

But give me one good reason you shouldn't have stayed in the crowd

You prolly got a Bender tatt on your back

Come on you can admit it plus the fact that you rap

Cxactly like him, and your girl lives in Canada, Facts

Y'all probably met on a Flight Distance battle rap chat

Back when I's packin a mac in the back of the lac

You was swagger jacking Patrick from his slacks to his hat

You and Osa battled you barely came at him in fact

He coulda stabbed your grandma you'd hand him the handle for that

No matter where you're at you land on they're sack asking for

Pats on the back as if that can grant you the talent to actually rap

I'll backgammon backhand him till he admit to snatching

The patterns they spat after the fact you talentless twat

Remember when I was gonna beat up Loe Pesci for being so messy

That shit played on his dome heavy

He all in his room like "I gotta get this Ness guy murdered"

Drinking, taking tablets like dishonest Best Buy workers

He wrote in his diary in broken english in cursive

All caps screaming n' cursing like I just wanna beat him and hurt him

Take my knee and insert it knee deep in his sternum

Then I seen him in person and didn't think it was worth it

Ya little awkward ass, dog you rap and that is how awkward sounds

You live in an awkward house without living in Okwerdz' house

You wanted to kill me that's like walking in Bonnie's house

Seeing her on the couch with lots of money... It's the thought (thot) that counts

You too cold for who, fool, do you know

I do own Lucifer's shoes to move through the snow

And who got your dude losing to Soul?

I'm looking at you sideways like, I was waiting on you from the doe

Let's get it clear boy we are not peers boy

I see the future you getting destroyed here boy

I'm clairvoyant there's no avoiding you hear boy

And I feel like roasting bring dat ass hear boy

You ol "I wallow in sorrow" face ass nigga

You ol "you got a trench coat I can borrow" face ass nigga

You ol, "I got a lotta homework I'ma do it tonight

Then go and shoot up the school tomorrow" face ass nigga

SOUL
This the last market where there's people you think I can't compete with

Well you'll be some of the last two I follow Fibonacci's sequence

They think Ness'll crush me, but this my bread and butter

Plus they thought you'd crush Swave, but you got head topped brother

You see - Ness got flustered, over what Jed's got covered

Down to a science, in cruise control like L Ron Hubbard

Plus every time you battle a black dude, your bars get thug

Like you mixing down and pitching out the cartel's drugs

But all that time not walking made his arms swell up

So if he working out the traps, that's a barbell shrug

Bro you are well loved, you know who you are, so rep it

Be like your broke legs, bone tendons, don't stretch it

Say the Steeler ram in their dome, I'll put money he won't, dead it

He'll take half back, so i'll match that… whatever Jerome Bet is (Jerome Bettis)

Soul Pettis, you a bantamweight with one bangin' tape like Caraway,

He the man in state? I'll Axe the A, Atlanta braves batting cage

That money was sound, I sculpted these rounds, that cash is clay (Cassius Clay)

....And this shit would make Mohammad change back his name

I'm back to old fashioned ways, give a fuck if what I'm rapping they catch today

Think him being black clouds that vision?

What I drop, burn him over the head like acid rain

You masquerade, Bruce Jenner cause you felt you had to change

Just cause other man would say that they raised ratchet K's

You went from RCA to getting smashed by Swave, how the fuck does that feel

You went from R Kelly, Parton, Presley, Usher and Seal

To Tony D's lone defeat when he struggled with Real

Cause they can't get in touch with T-Pain, since he fucked up his deal

And it probably didn't do much for your rep with RCA

When they found a bunch of beats made by T-Pain on Ebay

And the jokes thing is you probably helped all those guys

Cause you make incredible beats, and you get bread on the side

And that's Ness' career cause if he tells them he rhymes

He'll be sitting on the shelf till he dies

They say you're ahead of your time, so you wont get any shine

But that's enough about his career, and the dent in his pride

Cause I could spend three minutes on what one sentence describes

Always the Bridesmaid, never the bride

Round 3
NESS LEE
I said well it's the third round, it's the part where I gotta move you

You keep mentioning T-Pain, it's unfortunate I gotta let that auto tune you nigga

I told you four years ago we would probably battle, now we're finally meeting

And Eurgh gets the finder's fee for this minor league beating

But you climbed no higher than me, why? For these reasons

You might just be peeking (peaking) like hide and seek cheating

I said your time is over, no need to fight it b, I'll find your v

And end your life with two 9's fused together that's Siamese treatment

Your wifey acting like a speed demon

You gone come home early one night and find that she's creeping

He told me his shorty was acting like a whore again

So I told him get over hurr like Aye Verb quoting Scorpion

I convinced him to leave her, texted her that I work from four to ten

She came to my job at 8:00, slutty exes for the win

Now he staring at me like he wanna do something,

I'm feeling fairly scrappy what you tryna do cuzzin?

I'm with it sir you better get the burner

Cause as far as hands, I'm down to throw them over stairs/stares like attempted murder

I'm known to let 'em fly like the old Kobe

When I throw a right you're likely to find your soul floating

If we box I'll beat you till your skin turns black and blue

They gone be online debating whether you white or gold homie

I know, ye'en tryina get buried I feel ya

But you'll pay with your life don't worry I'll bill ya

And clean it up first things first if I kill ya

I cover all bases like a dirty outfielder

I'm nauseous, you made me face this sucker suck a sausage

You're unaccomplished find a draw bridge try jumping off it

And what is all this other nonsense about you punching Caustic?

...Dog that's fucking awesome I should give you a couple dollars

But I digress, I'll take your rib, you'll never get your baby back

You're really not an emcee, you only faking that

And you really want to prove me wrong so I raise the tax

Show me you can do it like this, now I'ma make you rap

Fourth quarters are preferred it's less pressure

I'm the perfect defender for the tournament ender

Ye'en heard the word I'm the desert bird on the dresser

I'm certainly worse than Serbian weather the first of December

And it has been determined forever that I will be determined forever

To rid the earth of every nerd in suspenders

Then I'm murdering Bender, return to his funeral service

Do the bird is the word, the Shmurda dance and merge em together, ya heard

Ayo Bender, I been calling you out for years, where you been at?

Next time you call me out in a battle, make sure you win that

SOUL
Lee endgames's a free checkmate

Cause his set ups all over the place, he's playing chess with DNA

So tonight, will B3 L's... like he's playing chess with DNA

When he bish up next to a rook... like he playing chess with DNA

See a pawn's what you be to (B2) these dudes, so that's where he moved

But they opened up the D 2, so the queen took a free rook

Put it simply, he's been used, so call me Aryan, but these views

Is deep blue, a machine too, he lose in three moves

Idun Beechu? Beat who? Give a beat to me you couldn't beat Tumi too?

See dude's schemes drew, weave through and it leaves smooth

So it seems cool but the ease you, do what he do and appeal to

The cheap ooh's, deceitful

Need proof? It must be true if I can beat dude and teach you

What Lee do with the same style that he use

It's simple as shit, you stick to the script like a read-through

Think I'm sick of this bit? I'm sticking with it, that's a preview

I'll breeze through, Bones Jones, go Ham'll defeat you

Fuck the towel that your team threw, if we lose it's a DQ

Get dough, Jeet Kun, we Bruce Lee's crew

Wake up from the dream too when I teeps you with Kareem's foot

This the game of death, bruv I had to fight my way up the tiers too

Now the Scot's (Scott) going beast mode like Teen Wolf

But after KOTD flew this Lee dude to the beach to

Not get past C3P0, like R2D2 in a green room

Pussy, this battle rap shit's something you bleed through

Nah you camel toe, seen his V through his jeans too like Evisu

It's a game boy, made it past an elite few, now you beat blue

For that money, I read, black for the green too like a healed bruise

This is Soul Volume 2, that's equal, to Lee cubed

This the PC he use to make beats through

When it crash, and then reboot, but the screen blue

And the CPU freeze too, cause this safe mode to what I'll command c: through

Ryu and T-2000 I'm heatproof

He's proof, heat could decease you, cause he breathed fumes

When the gas leak blew on a cheap fuse, that he keeps loose

Left his knee chewed, thats the only time he walked with the steel too

My point it this, it's ironic bitch, that the pain for this recruit

Was when he leaped to the same window that T threw his career throughWord to my fuckin American flag tube socks

If I catch you on the rooftop, you gettin Billy Boondock'ed

I'll pick up where I left off with Big T. Cuz you're my bro for real

Dog you will never know the joy of running through an open field.

You used to be skinny. Now you've got tits and a belly as well;

All of those extra helpings but you really weren't helping yourself.

You are so hungry. His favorite part of sex is eating ass.

Fuck a thousand reps, you're out of breath by the time that the beans are passed.

Some ham comes steaming past, you should see the way he react,

breathin fast like he completed a 800 meter dash,

he would gas, sweat beading, he eats or he's seizing fast,

sweaty wrists, feeble hands, all he is is a meaty slab,

sponge bath? They gon' squeegee that; Buffet? It's an easy pass,

and if you don't like fat jokes, well then fuckin stop being fat.

But Pete's a role model, and a G for sho.

But when I just said "Pete's-a roll model", all he heard was pizza roll.

If I think serial rape, I think one of the girls that Cosby has fucked.

If you think cereal rape, you're finishing a Lucky Charms box all at once.

If I think, my Woman Crush Wednesday, well, she's especially thick.

Your Woman Crush Wednesday is any Wednesday that you have sex with a chick.

But we both like sports.. Both count it as a hobby.

Some of enjoy playing sports. Some just enjoy watching.

Bro if you and I play sports, you would bomb like Nagasaki.

You get out of breath after a game of tonsil hockey.

You would get a concussion playing Fantasy Football.

You would tear your ACL playing beer pong - that's not a good look, dog.

We at odds like it's Vegas? Well I would be the favorite.

Mariota vs. Jameis, Tom Brady versus Peyton.

The star will get ate (8), so that makes him Troy Aikman.

I'll salute him, then put his ass a mile high - Terrell Davis.

I'll go shots to your temple, bro, fuck what this mark makin' (Mark Macon).

I'll put you on the sideline, chillin' with Nick Saban.

By now, bro you light off the top, that's Chris Kaman,

I'm the way Ray is with the Ravens or the Bears with Walter Peyton.

But you love talking through people's rounds. So you can't compare me to son.

It's funny you love sports, but you're a terrible one.

You have no basic rhythm. Your concepts are just forgetful.

So how can we go back to basics if you don't know fundamentals?

You have the most copied style. I've researched, it's true.

But if a million people can copy it. that means it's easy to do.

I mean you wish you could say you fathered me.

He wants me sisters with his daughter, he's weird, it's startin to bother me,

he called my pops about adopting me.

But I could boss you up up in your own house pussy.

You only had a daughter for the Girl Scout cookies.

So I don't give a fuck if you are one cool dad,

for me and your daughter, hey, fuck you, man.

THE SAURUS
This is how quick I'ma beat ya.

That was crazy how you went from a vocal impression of Bart then switched into Lisa.

Now I can promise y'all, in the worst way, he'll for sure hate my approach.

I can outwrite everything that this nerd say, and our wordplay isn't close.

I could punch him until he needs first aid, or shit could turn straight to a roast,

either way, this is gonna be the worst rape, since you were first raped, by your coach.

Last chance to bet on me if you ain't put your money up yet,

I'll wipe the Prince (prints) off of the scene, and they ain't found a bloody glove yet.

The shit about you, Penn State, Sandusky? All pretty fuckin suspect,

but I won't talk about you being molested ... It's a really touchy subject.

You're softer than a sunset. You're in over your head, Roney;

Philly folk, start spilling 40-O's for your dead homie.

You best show me respect owed or I'm exploding

in the House of Gods, bless Rone's soul, he'll get left holey/holy.

That's irony. Like a right from me leave his eye runny.

Get fried, but I'll crack somethin on the side, Sonny.

I heard it from the grapevine up in wine country

that he might take a stage dive for the prize money.

Now speakin of stage dives...

Let's talk about that Daylyt shit for a second.

You wanted to use a gimmick against him; he had different intentions,

but thinkin a Abe Lincoln impression would win shit against him?

That's the biggest bitch cop out since Olivia Benson.

He said he has a URL battle. ..But ain't nobody saw the shit.

So if KOTD's vaultin this, I think we know whose fault it is.

Yours. You gave it the old college try, now call it quits,

he balled his fist and tried to throw, I caught the pitch like Carlton Fisk.

Roney, this'll be your worst night ever.

Every line, every word I render. Do a worldwide web search,

name someone he's been served by better.

People barely show on this bitch like the first trimester.

Now... Have I mentioned how Sandusky molested you yet?

You're like his Jefferson Price. Hashtag #neverforget.

Now, I'm not saying he did the shit, and I'm not saying he's innocent,

I'm just saying, we can't judge Rone based on several thousand isolated incidents.

Round 2
RONE
I'm Brian Bosworth; I could do you like Okwerdz.

Grind them gears, watch we put (h)our hands to his face like clockwork.

You get hit and run just for fun like Dante Stallworth,

or you could catch the fade: corner route to Lance Alworth.

We could throw, like Brad Penny or Chad Henne.

You could catch the bam a lam like "Black Betty",

get served at any time of the day like you at Denny's,

I'm the fastest Italian since Mario Andretti.

But you the type to fall in love with a whore named Cinnamon.

Whore, The Saurus, ain't that a synonym of a girl that'll sin on him?

So I guess that makes me his antonym,

but they barely feel you like there's an ant in 'im;

You sound like a fag; you put the homo in homonym,

WRC shit, to homi him I'll sick Hom on 'im,

Dog, you look like you jerk off a ton!

Just like.. playin poker, watchin a bunch of battles,

you have to be jerking off all the time!

I don't have a punchline, just, we know, okay?

And here's another fact to make you think your whole life over:

you moved to Las Vegas.. to play online poker.

Bro, you could play online poker anywhere, from Peru to the Bronx.

So you chasin that dream, well that's an unusual thought,

but I think I know the real reason for you movin your plot -

You went cuz prostitution is legal, and you were due to get caught.

Fact or fiction? Your life is a series of bad decisions,

and now you can't get women but you blame your metabolism,

and in that condition losin weight's like crackin an algorithm,

cuz you couldn't so restraint if you were into masochism.

All stuck in a market(?), in your musty apartment,

dusty and dark with the fuckin musk of an armpit,

overrunning with garbage, blunt guts are discarded,

fuckin pizza crusts on the carpet, it screams "struggling artist",

All lazy, all day he just pushes a rolling chair;

the only danger he ever faces is when he gets close to stairs.

Wearing tighty whiteys, the holey pair, and a bathrobe as overwear,

your girl wear the same drawers Oprah wear with the weight, waist and face of a polar bear.

All you do is send tweets as you go through your day.

Oh good. Let's hear more about the poker you play.

When you break up with a girl, when a new one opens her legs,

as you have breakfast, lunch, dinner, and then both of your cakes.

But, I mean, when I call myself a slob, it's self-deprecating. There's some tact with it.

When you call yourself a slob, it is disgustingly accurate.

Fuck battle shit, the only time that he's an innovator

is when he taught his dog to fetch a beer from the refrigerator.

Is there a minute of your day that you're not looking at a screen?

Do you have bread, cheese, and meat with every meal that you eat?

Do you claim you're crushing life and that you're living a dream

when you're just a sweaty stereotype who's just obese and obscene?

See I stand for the U.S. and all that's great about us,

but you represent everything the world hates about us.

THE SAURUS
Me being what everyone hates might be true, fool,

But at least I don't remind everybody I'm a white skinny American every 5 seconds like you do.

I wouldn't say this if it wasn't true.

There's multiple people in this fuckin room who've ducked this dude,

that thought it would be more important to come to this event

than to battles that they'd booked with you.

But you wanna be that next artist KOTD will push hardest,

he from Philly, but his whole look started in Good Charlotte.

You cursed. Basically every battle you book's garbage,

cuz they keep hangin bud out to dry like a kush harvest.

Look, dog, we've all had opponents that ducked,

but it's gettin to your head, and now Roney's gassed up.

Fuck it, I'ma add to your stroke of bad luck.

They finally got a real test tossed at Rone (testosterone), now man up.

No weddings, no snow storms, no pathetic excuses.

No holds barred, no more respect for these new kids.

Nowadays, an up-and-comer testa a legend and loses,

and thinks he's seasoned in a day like a Netflix exclusive.

Not today though, not today, I'm borderline spazzin.

So before y'all try actin like this battle is some torch that I'm passin,

Watch - a super soaker vers' a .45 Magnum,

then see the poster boy gets posterized as Jordan flies past him.

I will flatline you Roney; this as easy as it gets.

A rapper vers' a gimmick that's been beaten half to death.

Plain as black and white, he'll hit you with some cheesy ass effects,

right off the Bat, man that's exactly why they bringin Adam West.

But can Adam test me? Can this nerd stand the pressure?

Well that's a long shot, like the Birdman director.

Homie when people see me they get excited like Santa Clause is coming.

When they see you, they're like "Oh look, it's the Daniel Tosh of nothing."

Round 3
RONE
So you call yourself the two time champ. And I like it, it's great.

I won the spirit award in high school tennis twice, so I can relate.

But "Mr. Two Time Everything"? Is that right?

So, the presidency? The Super Bowl, did you win that twice?

Oh, oh, you won two things two times. So you're the four-time champ.

Well I'm the prince of 16s, so I'm four times that.

Fuck your war cries; I'll wash em. Where the fluoride at?

With your fuckin rawhide face, man I'll pork rind that.

If I want your girl, I'll take your girl. Cuz that's just how she want it,

and I'm makin a de-posit right in her meat wallet;

he wears his rap championship rings when he's tryin to be brolic,

but it's no problem to steal your rings, I already done beat Sonic.

Dog, I could make you a better better, but I have lessons as well,

gambling is an addiction, so it's time we get him some help.

I have seen the girls you've fucked. Let's just say that you've had better.

Your range starts at fat heffer, and spans to transgender.

One looked just like you. I swear she was your fan member,

but it's no shock that a gambler has a terrible track record.

You're like a substance abuser the way you mortgage your future,

yo Organik, show me a gambler and I'll show you a loser.

Bro, even look at your battle career, because it shows that you're shit,

cuz if you were a good gambler, you would know when to quit.

You love to bet on yourself, like it's a game in your mind.

So I made up my own odds for you, on the ways that you'll die.

So heart attack? Two to one, that one was easy.

Ten to one? He goes to KFC and he chokes on a fuckin three-piece,

a hundred to one, he fuckin dies of lung cancer cuz he's been smokin like Chief Keef,

a thousand to one, he has a stroke.. of genius, and shoots right through these teeth,

half a million to one, he dies exhausted, fuckin hookers on repeat,

a million to one, he dies retired on a yacht out at deep sea,

a billion to one, he's trampled by fans wantin CDs,

or a trillion to one, he died of shock cuz he actually beat me.

My graveyard's riddled with tyrants, watch me belittle goliaths,

how many giants I gotta kill before I'm considered a giant?

The dun-dudda, god body, John Gotti with the wrench.

The West vers' everybody? How bout me vers' everybody on the West?

Who I beat? Bro, anybody in Cali or from Cali, I put em down in order.

Who I beat, and who's left, well the second list is shorter.

I turned Caustic into a personal information hoarder;

I made 360 one-eighty, sent him running across the border;

I turned Fredo to a angel, put that Baby in his corner;

I turned Okwerdz to a blogger, made him lose all his supporters;

I got Day laid out like it was frickin brick and mortar,

I turned Dirtbag Dan to a sideline reporter.

I would call out Dumb and Diz, but I'm not holdin my breath.

But shit, I think that they might be the only ones left.

See I get rowdy in the ring, I put a bounty on that thing,

they call me Roney Bae the Prince, but out in Cali I'm the king.

THE SAURUS
Lemme address that shit you little weak ass bitch -

I got two homies that you'll immediately lose a rematch with.

And here's the other part that wasn't fully complete with me,

you listed all the West Coast battlers you beat but somehow mentioned 360.

Who remembers when Rone said, "what I gotta do now to get love up on the stage?

Pull my dick out or punch someone in the face?

Nah, I'll just be me, cuz that's all it fuckin takes."

Or, a month later, I'll dress up like Honest Abe,

watch my opponent jump off the fuckin stage,

and I'll just stand there in a tophat lookin' like some sucka who got played.

But is Rone the #1 contender for the chain? I suppose.

But if he's the guy you chose, it was probably only... by a nose.

I dunno what Adam meant by great, but I'm adamant I'm greater.

This is like comparin Canibus to Drake, or analysts to players.

There's a major gap between us, and see that's the difference maker.

Some people say we're in the same class.. but so were Shaq and Christian Laettner.

Bitch you majored in Journalism. But nothing's happened yet,

except your mom and dad just split cuz they're a hundred grand in debt.

I've got a Master's in the same field, cuz I learned how to hit paydirt.

I took off-the-head lines and turned em into paper. That's a Journalism major.

Make your best shot, Prince, don't keep the king waiting.

I'll turn Adam to a bitch from a freakin rib breaking.

Every shot I land see my ego inflating.

It ain't even spring training and you see my swing changing.

Now everybody live tweeting, I want you take this down.

Rone's softer than a Charlie Clips name flip round.

Rone's softer than Charron's birthday cake is.

Rone's soft as being friends with strippers on a first name basis.

I hate to say it homie, but you got no identity.

White and skinny the only things that stand out to you specially.

So instead of spending three months doing your homework prep for me,

you could've looked in the mirror once and saw your own (you're Rone) worst enemy.

And I'm not saying I don't the know the difference between two genders,

but how come he 'n Bruce Jenner 've never been seen together.I want to let y'all know, I wasn’t even going to show up today

I got some bad news this week; my grandmother got bit by a bee y'all

It was one of them East African bees, it’s not funny

But when I heard this was for y'all, I showed up, so let’s get it

I said … Charlie, Charlie, Charlie…

I’ma be calm Charlie… I ain't gon lose my voice

"You’ll get engaged with the rage"… I ain't gon do that boy

This is battle rap, anything pass… we can scrap for that

Don’t stand here talking between my rounds… we got Smack for that

If I say something hot my nigga… I don’t want no daps for that

Oh you just want to be friends and play with these words…

Well they got apps for that

Fuck your entourage, this for that parmesan, since the boss been gone

You turn to Scott Baio and put Charles in charge

Cuz when Charles was gone he was dissin you saying that you owe eight

I got double that versus Surf and bought an Audi '08

He seen my car and was like you got all of them dollars

I know your persona… don’t hate

Oklahoma Nevada, your initial state was to NV (envy)… OK

So I can stand here laugh with him or I can kill 'em with the cold face

Cuz you took my bar verse Ars about brushing me wrong and flipped it with the Colgate…

That aint what the Don say

Who gave you bad directions, you lost… took it the wrong way

Now I got something that’ll hold clips so I load up with the old clips

First two was hot… and the third got stuck like the old Clips

You know the old Clips that stumbled in his old clips

Then said they old clips ohh Clips

You stumbled all 2013 and now you claiming you the best nigga

Since they gas em I’m supposed to be Pat nigga, well vrooom… I’m a 'vette nigga

And you X-Factor not cuz your priorities set nigga

Cuz every chance they get the fans make your head bigger

My first gun was a .38 revolver I got that from my nigga Roger

My point is… before I even knew about Clips I was already poppin

And jus cuz it was Grindtime, I didn’t stumble out or come up here with the…

I, I got you… duh duh duh… mumble mouth

Sonic the Hedgehog game, if I get hit on this stage, rounds keep coming out

You barely have thirds… at that point you should’ve got fired from it son

I/eye see you lazy like McGrady so you’ll never retire number one

He’s so redundant and simplistic, y'all all know that one Clips bit

Where he goes into a scheme and you can predict it way before he spits it

He’s like, I’m in that flying spur then I’m dunking (Duncan) in my homie's charger

Got twenty, take ya top off, that Ginobili spark ya

My other gun, Kawhi Leonard, this is the homie darker…

Then he’ll say something about point guard, a nine and what y'all see coming…

{Tony Parker} {CROWD PREDICTS}

What about when he said, I’m way better and way clever

Say something about Pacquiao or ring and what y'all see comin…

{Mayweather} {CROWD PREDICTS}

Hollow-vs-Clips-Hollow4
See what I’m trying to say, them bars like the next exit off the highway

They know when to get off you tell them it’s coming a mile away

But he does have fire writtens, he got fire writtens

Like when he said without Clips, Hollow aint killin’ shit

But if you freestyle half your battles, there ain’t no fire in pin/pen

Then what good is Clips

I aint saying your shit wack…

But bro is the same move every time you kick that

Setup punchline setup punchline that’s how you spit that

Just a candy wrapper/rapper with 4 bars you a… {Kit Kat} {CROWD PREDICTS}

See how easy it is to predict that

The aim gon’ change his range

The range gon’ change the bang

The bang gon’ change his frame

The frame gon… Boy yo bitch is ugly as hell my nigga

I mean his bitch aww

You like battle bitches with gun lines… bitches with bars

Rule number 1 this is a business and the mix is a flaw I don’t mix it at all,

You won’t hear a single drop bout I no Kendrick Lamar

But he went from Ash Cash now you hittin Couture

Nigga for bands I wouldn’t smash that no expensive guitar

She the one against Official dressed like a dyke right

Hair everywhere Scary Spice like

That bitch look like Whitney on the pipe night or Tina after Ike Fight

But you getting stacks now, get her hair done, put that hood boog in Fendi

Ohh I guess it’s your Lady’s Luck we never seen her look good with Remy

And you know what’s the saddest shit, I’ve been to they crib

When he mad at her and she mad at him… It’s hilarious

Cuz instead of arguments… they actually start battling

She be like: "If I come in and you textin, I bring the tecs in and start shootin"

He be like: "Shut up bitch you losin"

She storm out… go to the kitchen… she like: "Charlie, you ate my food again

Charlie, Charlie…" He in the back talkin bout "Guess what room I’m in?"

But… alright, alright… I ruined it…

Bro, third round against Rex… you said the truest shit

But please, please don’t come up here and act like your mom’s tough

Cuz I bet a thousand large bucks that in real life my mom will fuck your mom up

Iight, iight let me put this up, let me settle down

What he need to beat me, I'ma save that for the second round… L.O.M.

(Tried to do a "Sike I Lied" comeback but got cut off by the noise, Clips and Smack)

CHARLIE CLIPS
I said… Charlie Clips vs. Hollow

Lux what up? Mook what up?

I’ma kill one of y'all niggas this fuckin summer

I like how you talk that shit, here's where it goes down like a fuckin plumber

I body every nigga on your side, put em in sleeping bags that’s a fucking slumber

And if your mom do hook on mine… cool… we gon jump your mother

I said… uhmmm… ahhh man

I knew I should’ve skipped you and went straight to Lux

Cuz after that Total Slaughter performance, your career was kinda dead to me

But a little voice in my head, said naw you Clips and if you gon be the top gun…

Why not add a hollow into your legacy?

Plus I want to see what’s the hype about…

Cuz if you act like this then… How can anybody think you better b?

Your voice hoarse/horse, you leave niggas sleepy, Hollow…

That’s the reason you’re not ahead/ a head to me

I said nigga

You ain't beat grey hoodie Lux, you had the fake Black Panther,

With niggas in the background grippin a shottie

How’d ya struggle with fake activist/Actavis but lean is what you sip for a hobby?

The work I put in is rape, it's not meant for a Cosby

Burberry shirt, my lines gotta go over ya head first to see they meant for a body

My third round against Rex one of the best ever my whole block was movin

Niggas ain’t even asking bout my pops, they askin me how the Dots is doin

I tell them niggas Shine shinin, Murda murderin, shit… I think the Dots is movin

I aint wanna kill Rex… but when a dot get in ya face, you gotta oxy-cutem (execute 'em)

And what you gonna do, what you gonna do…

Rap about my pops like he did?

Pull out paperwork Hollow? I’m not shook

Nigga I haven’t seen my father in 20 years but still know how my pops look

My real name is Charles Brown and I be letting that stock cook

And if he try to Dee Brown… I will bang on em… and not look

Librarian… put the silencer on… shhhhh… if you do not book

Ahh it ain’t no Biggie, cuz you gon get a round, more than a Pac hook

I call my brother like… Bring the K D and then, Hollow give us that shock look

Cuz he got a feeling, the thunder about to get fired on the spot, ain't Scott Brooks

I said listen Hollow, if your bitch is fine, I’m bringing two fives to split ya dime

Chiropractor at King Of The Dot, I’m tryna bend her/Bender spine

Rondo workin out in the gym that’s the biggest nine

Shot the shit in East and/Easton… the nigga died in Pacific Time

Hollow-vs-Clips---Clips1
I’m loco… and bi-polar… Cuz I don’t celebrate but I wave toast

I’ll write Hollow is that nigga and that bitch on the same post

If you try me off the Hennessy then I hope you keepin your bae close

Cuz this little shit sing at niggas and bitches… it's Dej Loaf

Put a sock in it, I didn’t come here to show Dude Love

Arms out and everybody in your squad get it… that’s a group hug

Recyclin… I put the old beam on the new snub

The Ray (ray) and the Arsonal (arsenal) working together better than U Dubb

This is a part of war… I’m throwing smoke bombs at your apartment door

Niggas coughin they ain't feel Weezy this much since The Carter 4

Big shit barkin it soundin like a retarded dog

I’ll let this shit pow / Pau brother it fuck around and Mark us all / Marc Gasol

Fab put his shooters in the Uber, my whole team is in a rental

Window down, they arms out but they ain't reaching for your demo

I had to name the pump Ike, you gotta squeeze it just a little

Or the kickback will surprise you like Tina in the limo

I said on some G shit, Hollow you my nigga, but I need to know what the fuck is up

You had the chance to put battle rap on top of mainstream but then you fucked it up

It’s like every round you got dryer and dryer… man you fucking suck

How you was able to clean Big T but couldn’t wash Button-up / Budden up?

I said… Your third round better be your best round, cuz you not gonna survive another day

Every time I rap, pull out your phone and text your mother pray

Cuz she gon call Smack, Beasley and ask GOD why we took her son away

And the sad part it’s only 5 hours left till Mother’s Day

Mrs. Dinnananon wassup baby?

Round 2
HOLLOW DA DON
My nigga that round was cool… but yo bitch still ugly as hell my nigga

Nigga we see this… how you a top tier nigga… with a pg bitch?

Alright, alright alright… I know y'all don’t want to hear this

Enough about this nigga bitch…

Let’s talk about how this nigga bitched on a nigga dick for a year tryna battle, I had bigger fish

Needed an extension when I got Loaded I wasn't worried about little clips

All my battles been main events all types of rounds I raised the net

Since Clue was making tape cassettes and Jae Millz was in that Avirex

Nigga when I came in and went in, he came and went

So let’s place a bet, and when I win… Write R E S P E C T

When you make the check nigga pay respect

I said… these fans like the hot bars then…

But we don’t do that…

We all riders… I hate to use this bar during the crisis

I got to make the crowd riot so I'ma be more / Bmore fire

I got y'all… about a stolen scheme… He gave to another battle rapper but originally stole from Queens

It was about a vid… copped a Canon/cannon and shot one on fifth

It was Loaded Lux, T-Rex, Head Ice, Charlie Clips

(DJ scratching noise)

Let me rewind it… This about to be my hardest shit

Leave the cannon cocked I only need one shot when the fifth on me

I don’t care if Lux loaded it go through Rex tee hit Ice head then clip Charlie

I could’ve just came through and put two in his abs

And he was standing there looking at shit he never knew that he had

I’m hyped shooting Belly see me in Nebraska

I’m saying if he droppin dimes to get me to Rico I’ll havem eatin this banana

My man put away the ox so it’s the Tommy he gon blast at y'all

Me, Nas or T-Boz cuz I don’t know how to act at all

This Shotty ain't a battle rapper or a passenger seat

This nigga must’ve made a mistake/(him a steak) if he said he asking for beef

He left Ruby Tuesday to go to Friday’s to get a Sunday/Sundae

You just ate half of the week

But on Sundays he a changed man Charlie sits and stays home

It’s nothing religious… that's just usually when Chick-Fil-A’s closed

I said… Charlie… you gotta bring something better and that's… similes

These burners and gloves go together… that’s chemistry

I had an epiphany… they said before this battle shit

He was a Harlem nigga with no bread…

I said a Harlem nigga with no bread?

They said a Harlem nigga with no bread…

I said that’s like a BMX with no pegs

A frat party with no kegs

Friday with no Craig

A Harlem nigga with no bread?

They said a Harlem nigga with no bread

I said that’s a Rastafarian with no dreads

A goalie with no legs

A Cali nigga that smokes regs

A Harlem nigga with no bread?

They said yeah, he don’t even got a business or a LLC

Do you got an ENI number or tax ID?

Ohh the only thing you own is CharlieClipsTV

See that’s cuz he don’t got no will no drive no ambition

I seen all the money this man’s missin, I got a confession

See them “Sike I Lied” T-Shirts y'all bought outside… my man printed

Hollow-vs-Clips---Shirt
I seen all the money that fam missin

I’m like dog… I went and got it copywritten

Your whole slogan…so now if you want to use it

You gotta pay me some damn chicken… boy you do bad business

I actually got employees… you can come work for me

An in turn/intern my nigga you get that work for free

I’m not showing his incompetence with no cruel intentions

Own equity it’s no equity in views and mentions

But if it is y'all went in on a Charlie Clips stock and made a huge investment

But now that I’m giving you the business watch them start losing interest

My nigga you gotta start thinkin like a boss or I office/off his space

And leave his achievements on the wall

Wait you from Harlem… you aint got no damn bars

But you flippin put your man on… damn pause

Wait… now I’m sounding like Cam’Ron

Y'all Ghostface twice the killer she died, I was knowing that sick

I’m the type to overdose with the shit,

I challenge you to battle without ghostses

If son back out, I black out my solar eclipse/soul'a eat clips

I know y'all was like damn… I was fucking with thun

See Smack was frontin with funds, is DNA your brother or son?

I know y'all like it’s crazy on how I’m coming at son

But his name's Clips, it's only right that I put ’em under the gun

By the way your weight fluctuates like a boxer going up in weight

You're fat big boned and you're big fat boned the other day

I no longer know what the fuck to say

I went by his crib he was eating a buttered steak with a cup of cake

That wasn’t a dumb mistake I didn’t mean cupcake he was actually drinking a cup of cake

Worry about the bars but don’t worry what I got on

But if you is worried LOMclothing.com

Sike I Lied I’ma say it now… Sike I Lied I’m a say it now…

In order to make that happen, you’ll have to run in the Vatican church

Ransack it grab the pope saran wrap him back hand him like Sam Jackson

Cremate his damn ashes with no damn hassle

Pull it out of the damn oven and make a sand castle

CHARLIE CLIPS
Second round was all jokes for you huh?

Crack another fat joke and I'ma go for your jaw

I've been in the streets, they know I’m gutta without bowling a ball

Two plus two… Remember I’m predictable… I’m holding this four

Sike I… oohhhh wait I don’t own it no more

I had a long talk with D the other night…

His bitch walked by with a mean butt

And I was thinking like damn… I gotta bag her… Fuck raw and catch a mean nut

D said can I hang…I said for sure… you know how we do these sluts

Ohhh y'all think I was talkin bout DNA… I’m talkin about deeez nuts

GOT HIM!!!

Hollow crack a smile… it’s just a joke…try to save ya pride

Shut the fuck up with the boos… hop in the whip we bout to take a ride

I gotta take y'all in a trip… cuz a couple of niggas I thought was cool with me started taking sides…

Charlie-Clips-vs-Cortez-Hollow
Cortez what up nigga… Come here boy…

Cortez what up nigga… You know I know you personally in the streets you real

But in this situation… you a fuck nigga

Cuz I heard you had a couple of words… behind ya boy back when Math had got jumped nigga

You know what’s crazy? When you ain't had no crib… I was there to move ya shit out the trunk nigga

Hollow aint never let you stay at his house… you lived with me for a month nigga

This is real facts

You know what’s crazy? I guided you through your whole career

I held you during that whole Hollow bid…

Sad part about it, he come home and you jump in his arms LOM…

NY did way more for you than Hollow did

He moved to Orlando, question do you even know where Hollow lives?

If this is really ya man, give me the address right now to Hollow crib

Exactly… Damn you said it type fast…

Well let me do it over here cuz GOD is about to strike his ass

Not just you…

D. Chamberz…You mentioning me in all ya songs

Sad part is you don’t even know how to rhyme…

You used to call me seven o'clock every morning…

Begging me to help you get on your grind

I got more features with you than all of these niggas combined

So I’ma be the first to tell you that you suck and you’re never getting signed

I know what y'all thinking…

Y'all niggas wanna boo niggas…or a nigga who battled Surf and started making it rain

Y'all love me a minute ago now y'all getting as fake as his chain

The problem that kills me is y'all niggas big Hollow up

And y'all wanna soup him like y'all wontons

Y'all ain't with him for real… y'all only with him for the chips like Bon Ton

LOM NYB you always got y'all pom-pom

But where the fuck was y'all when he was getting washed up by John John

I said…

John John walked in and he said LOM… then swung at him right at the door

But you fell… I got a multiple choice on how you got on the floor

Is it…

A) The floor was slippery, you fell inside the club

Is it…

B) When you grabbed him you realized you not a thug

Is it…

C) It wasn’t lean it was some other kind of drug

Ayyyee John John what was it…

*John John comes out and says*

(It was D nigga… all of the above)

Round 3
HOLLOW DA DON
With the Math situation… we ain’t saying you did not care

We ain’t say go to LA shoot everybody bring a glock in there

But bro… you is big as papa bear…

You could’ve grabbed disaster or Aktive and stopped 'em and been like "not in here"

And he tried… but once them L.A. niggas started swinging you got outta there

Your heart was pumping my nigga… you know what’s funny

Besides the fact that he’s the only Harlem nigga that comes bummy

He’s so excited to get his little twenty thousand and I’m still spending Lux money

Even though money don’t matter here, I’m just here stating the facts

Clips this is the most you ever been gave for a match

And bitch I’m not Lux, you better thank me for that

Cuz before this I know what happened… me and Joe… had a classic

But I never give y'all the insight on my life… so let me tell y'all what happened

What you know about preparing for a battle when your grandmother bit by a bee

Or… the very same day of the battle… you forget your ID…

Real shit no excuses… wait… that ain’t me… that’s what this nigga do

If he unprepared during the battle he’ll give an excuse…

Embed it in the fans' heads that can bicker and use over did he win or did he lose

Like, Clips what happened against Charron?

Ohhh ohhh my nigga, that day of the battle my nephew caught the flu

Well what happened against Illmac?

My nigga that very same week of the battle my daughter in law turned two…

I gotta throw a surprise party… It’s real shit I’m going through

Niggas is like C'mon Charlie quit with the sobbin

You think these niggas wait hours and pay $100 to come in here and hear another nigga problems?

Hollow-vs-Clips---Hollow1
Now I’ma pull up on the block… I’ma freestyle off the top…

Sike I lied nigga… I couldn't stand up here and gave y'all a sloppy freestyle if I tried nigga…

Wait this is genius… I can do this everytime nigga I get in a bind nigga

Just say Sike I Lied and rhyme nigga… my nigga

It's so see through…

Then Star popped the clip called you a snitch…

But Clips aint pop shots…

You was standing there dancing round questions and knowing that’s what got ya pop locked

Let's keep it a buck… Rex said he was with Alpo… and his pop flossed in a Lex coupe

So if Rex was with Alpo and your pops was… it was a boss for respect too

But there’s something else about you and Alpo my nigga…

There’s something more that connects you

Ahh it’s so special… y'all both came up of killing a nigga when he was mourning his nephew

Snitching in your DNA, so DNA… if you start selling coke and you wanna get down, tell em NO

It’ll sound like a Sixers game… he’ll be playing with the Answer as he points… that’s Eric('s) Snow

I'll bring two weapons through, for snitches in the confessional

A tech and a nickel if you wanna be technical

Let's get to the point… you sarcastic hardy har

But couldn’t hang with me bar for bar in New Orleans during Mardi Gras

If your man acting extra goon, leg shot when I’m stepping to 'em

Split your shit right before I left the room nigga that’s an exit wound

And bystanders get brutally beaten for beefin

Brooklyn born we’re brought up blind with beacons

Not concerned with the corner concoct concurrent coronas

Come with a caliber Charlie Clips condition confirmed in a coma

I’m just playing with these letters and tryin to be non bias

I did some Bs B and some Cs see… stop whining (CeCe Winans)

I was in the box where niggas was not rhyming

Ayo sticks and Top Ramen

You nerds dot com'in and hating for the top comment

I’m illegal but legal with desert eagles to see you Eagles and Regals leaving you see through… I equal them people that peeped you like a preview

A sequel, shoot that needle with diesel position leaving you fetal

Wait… I can’t use mixtape bars? … That’s cheating scrap

But he did that with the Captain Morgan line in the Conceited match

And he act like it was a free at that…

Had me so heated that I was on his locator visit every place that he be at

You can see that I listen to all of his CD tracks…

And read every tweet he had… all 98,322 to be exact

But who’s countin?

Fuck you nigga…

I was stalking everybody, even the niggas that hold this nigga down

I'm like… should I get at Clips? yeah well let me roast this nigga now

Clips aint fat… he just got a big ol back

My nigga you got a wide body… you a big ol 'Lac

I hate to be your friend when we was young and some kids wanna scrap

Cuz it prolly be hard as hell to get your back…

I'll palm the toolie… he gon take shots to the head like John Belushi

I’ll put this bitch on ice like Yamaguchi

Silent killer for the mob… that’s Sean Kakhuski

See I usually don’t stop y'all during these battlin verses but I guarantee there’s a few of y'all that thought that Sean Kakhuski was an actual person…

Be the same niggas that fall for Clips' fifty and fifty nine
Surf with an AR on his hip… I don’t get it when they rhyme

But enough of that y'all aint seen me mad

I guess y'all right the devil wear Prada…

… Cuz I'ma bouta get my evil bag

I'ma skinny nigga… I could care less about grandma good ass cookin

You fuckin with a crazy nigga…

… That’ll run in the crib and give grandma that good ass whoopin

But y'all know im so motherfucking mean with it…

I take that grandmother ass whooping back and do a whole 'nother scheme

I said I’m probably just weird

As I walked up the stairs I broke a bottle of beer

Bent her over stuffed it hard in her rear

Twist it out as the bottom just teared

Blood was everywhere, a lot was smeared

And I used it to write on the wall “Hollow was here”

But y'all know I'm so motherfucking mean with it…

I bring that grandmother ass whooping back and do a whole 'nother scheme

She senile... can’t tell who what which and when

I took doo doo from her diaper with some chocolate and mixed it in

Fed it to her, told her it’s a twix and then…

She said is it supposed to taste this nasty?

I said honestly the shit depends

She said on what?

Repeatedly she get beat with an iron…

And I tell your grandfather… get the fuck up out that wheelchair

And I sit down like… “Wheeewww” nigga I’m tired…

That was a long day of ass whoopin for Charlie Clips…

Damn your shirt hardly fits…

FYI… they got the salsa chips avoid the garlic dip

I’m just being real with you… I’m knowing this true…

Your face could tell it hurts inside of you…

CHARLIE CLIPS
How this shit go again?

"Your man Charlie Clips had one battle and think he top three now

And how his name Charlie Clips if we only seen three rounds"

Damn that was tough… that was back when he was hungry, fire, and pause… you had a lot of flame in you

But over the time you became a vending machine Hollow…

You don’t know why?... I’ll explain it to you

See Shady Records got a little hungry… they push buttons/Budden… and you was the one they put the change into…

You chased that man around more than Kaylin Garcia it was to the point I felt ashamed of you

You threw money on stage and told Surf to strip… it was at that moment I seen the lame in you

You flew Calicoe’s pops a thousand miles and still had a debatable with Lux… Hollow you let the fame get you…

See I wanna show you this 40 Glocc… but I'd rather school you before the Game get you

Cuz you chose the stage name Hollow… and it’s crazy how that name fits you

Cuz see the definition of hollow is basically unfilled space… and with a name like that… how could y'all even think he gon bully Clips…

Cuz see what bothers me is that he chose a name that means empty…

But your whole career you’ve been full of shit

Shall I continue? Work out Hollow, let's see what being brolic get you…

Till a chhhh chhhh… till a hollow hits you…

And the doctors change your name while you asleep… cuz you done woke up with something solid in you

But oohhhh… you not that type of hollow… you an expanding bullet…

Basically you a hollow point

But if we go to trial and Hollow point at the nigga that shot the hollow point then what the fuck is Hollow’s point?

Exactly… see you didn’t choose the name Hollow… God gave it to this man and the shit special

See he gave him the name Hollow cuz he’s sharp and with the right aim he probably could split metal

But you're just a Hollow so stay in ya lane…

Cuz when you went against an Arsonal… we all seen how that kid stretched you

And remember Hollow can’t go nowhere… unless the clip lets you

This is some powerful shit… I understand y'all gon get it… don’t worry about it…

I probably won this round on that alone…

One lil scheme and a lil bit of wordplay

You wanna know what’s crazy Hollow?… I ain’t spit a punchline since like Thursday

You want one?... Ok cool… You about to get 'em in a bomb way

From now on May 9th is national What-The-Fuck-Happened-To-Hollow-Da-Don Day…

I’m extra legit… I got a gift at rapping you in the presence of Clips

Imodium… hey D (AD)… don’t let him get extra with shit…

Cortez… real name is Ernie and he rollin with Hollow looking all desperate and shit

Now Ernie the one I should kill/Shaquille if Charles right next to the Smith

Hollow go head and give it up… give it all you can

But let ya next of kin know that I’m the God in the clutch

Remember he played Street Fighter he never used Balrog.. and left y'all in disgust

Well I used to battle rap for free in the yard before lunch

Till I picked Balrog... and learned you can charge for a punch

It’s over… Yes Hollow… he da best

I’m in ya mom's crib… she need a vest

Tryna leave blood all over the pad… but it aint PMS

Ski mask on… 40 comin out the waist… she about to see her death

They aint see the Black Face raisin the Cal since BMF

And you said you could beat me bar for bar, Hollow?

I’m from New York where we let off rounds

And my niggas Will Smith you for seven pounds

Wait wait wait… that’s X-Factor shit right

I’m buggin y'all I gotta chill…

How bout? Grown man bars is something he got… wait that’s Rex shit right…

Yeah I’m buggin y'all for real…

How bout? So it’s Showtime…

Stupid nigga I’m not tryna steal…

I’m Shang Tsung… I’m just turning into all the niggas I already killed

Hollow-vs-Clips-Clips2
My legacy is solidified… Drake voice… your shit is kinda iffy though…

You beat Illmac after Con beat 'em… You beat Big T… OK really bro…

I murdered Verb, I murdered Roc… And what I did to Rex… silly though…

And Factor? His career been fucked… that ain't even going to Xvideos…

So lemme ask y'all in the crowd… Raise your hand if you think this sucka a legend

I did at first till Arsonal killed em… No debatin

Nigga fucked up his record… Then he lost to Surf right after that…

See I don’t fucking respect it…

I just wanna know… When you go against Red mans (Redman/O-Red)… what the fuck is your Method?

Listen Hollow… I am the greatest… I do believe in the hype…

But let’s just say niggas don’t think I’m Jordan…

And Mook laughin cuz he thinkin he Mike…

But when Mook lil daughter gets older and they go to ask her who the God…

She not gon remember Michael Jordan… but she always gon remember Lebron…

I’m about 6’8, 6'9… 250… niggas get scared when I come to the fucking basket,

I jump in traffic, they say I’m not aggressive because I might up and pass it…

Ohhh yall still thinking I’m talking about Lebron…

Naw nigga I’m old school… I fuck with Magic…

I compare myself to him… cuz I’m sick and my son a faggot…

And ya snooo datttt

This nigga will never be Michael Jordan…

If anything he Pierce… but the reason why I compare him to Paul is wonderful…

See you talk down on niggas like you a wizard… tryna makem feel all uncomfortable…

You tough when you was with Brooklyn…

But when you not with your team you soft and huggable…

I ain't gon lie you the truth… but your career is gon end with this Wall in front of you…

I could’ve spit a thousand fucking bars this round…

But this nigga needed to be humbled…

Yes Hollow you need that…

That LOM shit you got on your chest…

You talk it but I bleed that…

Drake offered me $20,000 to battle DNA…I turned that shit down like I don’t need that…

I didn’t even battle you for myself… I killed you so my little brother could have Queens back…

Loyalty Over Money…

I told you Hollow if y'all remember in the first round,

I said make sure your third is your best, or you're not gonna see another day

Every time I rhyme, take out your phone and you better text your mother pray

Cuz she gon hit Smack, God and Beasley and ask why did you help take my son away

What time is it? It’s only about five hours left till Mother’s Day

Let's get one thing clear boy, you don't deserve to be the champ of Britain

But I'm gonna give you the beating you deserve… since they gave you the battle that you didn't

But if you think you deserve this, here's some stuff to consider

Look at the facts, you're 2012's runt of the litter

You lost to Ogmios, Bam, and and weren't judged against Chilla

In fact… the last solo battle you won was… Enigma?!!?

Bruv while you went 0-2, I went 6-0, you shouldn't be allowed on stage

You get killed at home, I been winning in Canada, and now the States!

Eurgh, you should have your head down ashamed

Cause you gave a title shot, to a guy, who ain't won a battle in over 1,000 days

Let me put that into perspective, for those who are gassed

You haven't won a battle since Tone was the champ

You haven't won a battle since Osh was the champ

Bruv! You haven't won since before I was banned!

You're not champion level, might as well just hand me the medal

Pin it on me like we amateur wrestle cause right now,

You in the woods with a bag full of pretzels

And handing out bread'll get him shown up every which way like… Hansel and Gretel

You can't handle this level, while I battled the best, and traveled for several

Canada's vets'll Atlanta for Ness and Africa's next'll, happily shell you

For thinking that you are special

Get his head wrapped and his boat rocked like Somalian rebels

He starry eye'd, turn his glasses to bezels, a cat in the kennel

Done being a joker, bruv, I'm bout to snap with the pencil

I pull rank I'm general…

Think my sons gonna win?

Betty Wilma kids playing like Bam Bam and Pebbles

The standard I set'll, be where the battle standard gets settled

Since set the standard it's been your standard to settle

Well I'm gonna throw on one of your wack instrumentals, and skank in your temple

Cause you been walking with god… and now you're stuck here in a dance with the devil

B-b-b-bully who? You think I'm actually shook of you

End it, your life time battle record is 2-2

And it's funny, that your life time battle record is 2-2

Cause you ain't won a battle in 3 years that's not a 2 on 2

I've proved myself… by myself… I'm the man in the promotion

But watch his bars crumble at the top... for relying on crackers to support him

You got a third rate work rate, look at the ink that the guys used

I got more ink in my passport than marks poured in his rhymebook

So this ode to you ain't owed to you, last title match even tony knew

Really, they should have traded Dialect vs. Soul for you

You only got the shot, cause DF base the league out of London

You think you'd get the shot, if it was based out of Leeds then you're buggin

You think you'd get the shot, if the champ was Tony D, then you're bunnin

You think you'd get the shot, if they hadn't already set up you vs. me then you're struggling

To see what they've done and the reasons they've done it

Now ask those same questions to me, and you can see what is coming

You are surplus to requirements, this title match is me vs. someone

And don't give me that "You don't make music shit", I won't press any songs

Reason being... I don't waste energy on things there's no equity from

Cause when you're from Fife… fuck artistry, just worry about getting dough

Lochgelly's own, check the polls, 9,000 men that don't have any hope

I seen 3 Q's as a kid, I wasn't selling dope

The only queue's we've ever known! Pension, dole and methodone

In my teens, the high street was boarded up abandoned buildin's

What used to be the institute, overrun by rats and pigeons

Lowest house prices in the U.K. thanks to Thatcher's Britain

So don't chat your shit, like London's the only place the working classes live in

Smack addiction got them on that 40 milligrams in liquid

At the clinic looking like Anakin when his hand is missing

Now do think that Razer in my hand bar was fact or fiction

And I'm not glorifying anything, that shit was a bad decision

Now you say you don't glorify it, but look at what he has been spitting

He's a hypocrit, it's about straps they're gripping, and the man they're killing

And all they wanna do is ride… well I'm a Mustang Sally driven

Advocate of pacifism, stop rappin bout your "mandem pitchin"

Cause I don't talk advocate that lifestyle… even if it's that or prison

I'm only mentioning it now to tell you pack it in cause they can't distinguish

But don't tell me I couldn't walk a mile in Stanley's boots how the man was living

When I used to have to walk around with a Stanley in them

CEE MAJOR
I’ll have you unsure of the shores that you’re searching for

Was testing that thunder in your stomach really worth the storm?

The curtains draw while this bitch gets wrapped, like Persian broads

Come at Cee (Sea) get fucked up in every way possible, that’s Murphy’s Law

I’m certain, sure you are not closely prepared

It’s summer time… so I’m on my Spanish shit again. So if I say I’m son (sun) him I’ma leave Soul(Sol) in the air

Your fanbase? Miniscule. But don’t be surprised they’re not opening ears

You made a career battling nobodies… that’s why nobody cares

Give it a rest

Oh, but you battled Ness in Atlanta and he's considered a vet?

And you a hit on the net?

This ain’t the 90s nobody gives a fuck about Mitchell and Ness

You’re on the big cards, but guarantee the no-namers get this guy

You battled a dude called Pigsty…

Before I battle someone with that name you’ll see pigs fly

I used to look up in amazement at this guy, now I’m just looking down, in amazement, like…

This guy

You lost my ratings at a rate I can’t describe

It’s like you’re playing the antagonist from the Hannibal flick, because you lost face to that pig sty

So you’re on a new flight every week? Battling out of country, living the life of your dreams

I get it, you’re getting busy on the grind for your team

But that’s Canary Wharf shit, because you stay getting busy, but you’re still light at your peak (you still light at your peak)

You a rider then? Please. You dope then J?

So I’m gonna size him up just to cut him down, like an O of yay

Spiritual being, but don’t consider me and Soul the same

All the references from Soul are plain, these punches will have him travelling through Solar planes

Soul was taking shots, but see it’s souls we take, we lower graves

If Soul’s a name, this? Sosa’s aim I’m taking over Tony’s place.

They say "those that mind don’t matter and those that matter don’t mind"

They say you deserved the title since your battle with Matter.

Now that doesn’t matter, that’s mine.

It’s that time, he dies before I even got to land mine

Cardiac (Cardiak) shit, before I dropped this beating (Beat in) you heard the flat line

If it’s drama school him. Drama school shit, we put a mark down if he don’t act right

They said get the boy with the Death Note, I said ‘That’s Light’

Your name’s Jed ‘Mitchell’, Well it doesn’t matter where your fam’s tied

I’ll run up on your family tree and open up a branch like a franchise

He’s been letting the fame get to his head, he better hang tight

Before Cee makes him capsize, just to reduce his cap size

You’re the best rapper in your hood, but where you from fam? Fife

Fuck you and your bagpipes, with my hands tied I could run through your city like a tramline

Fuck being PC, I’d rather say ‘I’ll let the metal connect like a flashdrive’

Because I’ve been making movements from the groundwork, this is about to be a landslide.

I’m a certified killer, you can check the portfolio,

Homie know I break a body down like Polio.

But seeing as it’s bait enough for them to quote it

I’m gonna make a quick amendment to the old script.

I’m certified, kill him on cam, we don’t need the portfolio shit

I’m back in all types of ways, that’s Scoliosis

Homie know this, I’ll kill a rapper in a moment’s notice

Soul is bogus, as soon as you talk arms, I can see you’re a target, Stoney clothing

I’ll make Soul fly, Holy Ghost shit, the second I dig this hole, he’s ghosting

My cornucopias boasting, while you on the net like Kournikova, posing

So I’ll roll up with a couple Codies and decode his whole shit

Like ‘what you testing Cee for (C4) you know the kid is so explosive’

Plus you look like an Oxfam ad with your shoulders bulging

Brother, you put the ‘fam’ in famine, I don’t condone this

You need to stop ’eating rappers’ and eat a meal, but Soul you know this

You only called Soul, because this ain’t enough body to hold a Soul in.

Jed Mitchell… I could deadlift you

With these bars, I’ll lay him flat, just to lift him up, let’s get technical.

Round 2
SOUL
Let's get one thing clear boy… you don't deserve to be the champ of Britain

The style you use… I manuscripted you're just another man that bit it

But since my old style is the one Cee is gonna use tonight

Figure I might as well show him how to do it right

That style was one failed experiment, I gave this monster life with

So this the scene Dr Jekyll bodies Hyde in

I'll keep it simple… Get the off my dick and stop the biting!

I will pen circles around C... cause he copy writing

Bruv you even bite religions… remember when you were in mass?

But gave his crucifix back, now the Muslims his fam

The same faith that turn Cat Stephens to Yusuf Islam

He went from peace train, to Fatwas, so what's the use of Islam?

And I'm not even gonna front like I read the Qu'ran mate

But you said yourself, you'd never have that separatist part played

But said you're colder than ISIS… they'd send him back our way

They've got 2 eyes you can't use, and 2 s's you cant say

He's on an attitude era World Wrestling Federation flex

Cause you're a Christian that fakes violence, just so you can gain an edge

But how I'm killing these 2012 dudes, he shoulda stayed with Jessie James instead

Cause you don't pac, gunn's, on road dogg, I'll have the whole of D Generation X'ed

If he running with the blades instead, I'll ether my clones

This a seed that I've grown, and now it's time to reap what I sewn

I just had leoned a weekend ago

So I'll put an end to Cee era, blood I'm in a league of my own!

I been in this though… a 3 60's writers like Tinchy Strider

Before URL turned everyone into Twitter hypers

Cause the kid's a liar so if he spitting fire while his flints expired

You just using that red dot to gas them up like a clipper lighter

You're a bitch attire, should showed up in a partly cropped army top

You been backed into a corner by more teenagers than Lara Croft

It's just bars he drops, think he just phone a friend, I'll be found bleeding

Well let's ask the audience… you think he got people in the crowd squeezing

I'll split I'm like 50/50… they're like wait… is this clown scheming?

Chris Tarrant quiz faggot, I'll give major the coffin without cheating

That's the 4 bar set up style I used to use, that you would use in 2 on 2's

But now I feel like cooking you sooo

Your pen game less dope my pen game Death Note, let's go

I can't bail out tonight, like death row...

He got a 4:4 it's a tempo

I'll hold down Cee, so the 1st 2nd and 3rd, I'll make him fret those

I start dead slow, and end dope, but you bout to get both

Barrels from the whistle like Omar in the trench coat

Head stoved, neck bone, exposed, legs broke

You'll get a feature on your medical record… by Necro

I got gas in store… like Esso's at Tesco

To shake him up, then explode like Mentos in fresh Coke

You G aye, you're GI, Destro, against Joe

Lace him up over that hard front like some shelltoes

Read him while I'm training to work… he's like the metro

This is violin, organ, bass, tubas and cellos

In the pit going out with a bang, when I wave elbows

So watch… I'll turn one Cee Major to a crescendo

CEE MAJOR
I grew up in the East side, where we grew up idolizing that Ghetts off Risky Roadz

Now I’m on the stage and he’s in the crowd – salute king – I guess that means me and Ghettz are switching roles

Because they gave Freedom of Speech to a Rebel With A Cause – causing deadly metaphors

These words? A Ghetto Gospel… Noah in the Old Testament, this Cee’s killed many men before

This a connect call with Flex, they put Digits on the line

Now you’re living for a sport, your life can finish on a line

It never matters the victim they assign, I’ve been on it from a cub, I’m grown now I’ll kill him for the Pride

Breaking bread with my killers it’s time for dinner then we dine, we need dinner then you dyin’

They put the footage on loop like I did it for the Vine

Don’t ever get it twisted, raise your fist up and get hype

That’s Bikram yoga, because it gets heated then you’re in a difficult position for the night.

So, Soul how does it feel to be so-so

No, Soul you need to find a name that fits, you’re an atheist stop tryna take the piss you have no soul.

And your girl's name’s Shabnam Azad

I’m sorry… but I’ve never heard a name as bad as that

Long distance, so your sex life is ‘space bar, space bar, enter, backslash…. Hashtag’

Cyber boy I wonder how many real men Shabnam Azad(as had)

Isn’t this a bitch, you’re catching the burn from that yellow thing like Piccadilly dip

‘cos while Mr. Mitchell’s in the bits, searching for a figure just to figure out what intimacy is

His girls kicking it with them French players, like Ibrahimovic

Wa’um star? We can go arm for arm and it’s not Krav Maga

But hype cos I dissed your little Indian, God you’ll need more arms to start

Before that red dot’s at your temple like the Taj Mahal

So you don’t wanna rival Major, I’m the boss, Oh (on) this stage here? That’s final player

I’m making noise off these lines, like a vinyl player

But they ain’t wanted to hear a Soul sound since Motown made vinyl, player

So how can you place him in a bigger league?

From the weigh-in I knew I was gonna weigh him in I’m with it, b

Don’t even have to go out of my way to kill him lyrically

On my gospel singer shit… I put faith in this ability

And man know the world view I hold’s religious

So if we’re talking Bodying (Body and) Soul, the concept’s so intrinsic

But I can switch it and have son solar eclipsed.

If I show you how I got this down to a science, Soul don’t exist

Because I’m unparalleled, our paths can’t coincide

It’s lonely at the top. I look around there ain’t a Soul in sight

But lemme give Soul insight. I’m here to take the title and do you damage

I’m killing two birds with one stone, I’m a frugal Arab.

On my first time buyer, this is practice holmes (homes)

I’ve been sharpening my tools like a blacksmith and I’ve got more than enough spirit to be a match for soul

You match fit? So! I’m doing more than well.

You’ll end up kicking the bucket tryna catch this flow.

But no lie, workrate wise I can’t fuck with Soul

You did 35 battles… last month alone

But I fly the box office, I define a hot topic, hence why I did one battle last year… and got a title shot off it.

I ain’t even in my hay day Soul

And I’ve recouped more interest than a payday loan.

‘cos I just drop some Fire in the Booth and kick back on some sloth (Charlie) shit

You? The man they see working. Me? The man they stay watching

But if clashin’s the topic

As long as you’re ready to take that ‘L’ and give me the cash in (C*ash in’) I’m on it

I get busy ‘til my blade’s brown (Blade Brown) I’m ‘bout to bag him and box him (Bags and Boxes mixtape)

Because, Yes we the realness…. Nah Je Suis (‘’Je suis Charlie Hebdo’’) the realness,

See how calling me out ends up bad for you comics

So how do you think he’s the truth, he moves how an idiot moves

This sucker, sucker punched Caustic, then had to sprint from the room

But the fact you didn’t knock man down exposed your lineage too

Because you’re moving like a duchess… just a bitch with them dukes.

So if it’s bar then it’s bars let’s keep it at that

Because you’d be seeing a death (deaf) sentence if I’ve got to speak with my hands (sign language)

I’ll knock Jed out, for real

Drake shit, If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late shit

Because he see these (CD’s) drop, then he’s looking for a clause just to get out the deal

So they’re gonna have to phone the papers when this man gets smoked to vapors

On reflection, I don’t wanna hear nothing, anechoic chambers

Because I’m good in my hometown, but Gotham shit I’m gonna kill him with a next city

I’ll make you hop along like Cobblepot if you try and get fresh with me

I’ve got some cronies like Don Maroney… flex with me

I’m Harvey Dent palming pence, because no matter how you flip it there’ll always be heads with me

Jed today you tempted fate

You’re center stage with Hemmingway

This? Em and Jay on Renegade

Fuck an outcome, when this comes out, we’re both legend status anyway

He’s mentioned he’s a fan of mine, can’t talk like I ain’t said the same

But you’re in front of a fanatic with his weapon aimed, you can go the Lennon way

So remember the name, I’m on my Henry the 8th

I’ll rip a rappers head off, I’m just waiting for my severance pay

Lemme explain. I’m a Barbarian, these bars? ‘bout to bury the game

I’m at a point where they check for my name, you? Dying after a checkpoint

I’m just setting the levels again

You rappers’ all bitch made, getting wet for the fame

You’re in your Lelli Kellys tryna step in the rain

Rappers I’ve sonned, sonned rappers that’ve sonned rappers, my shit pops on a grand scale,

You best accept that I’m great.

Round 3
SOUL
Let's get one thing clear boy… you don't deserve to be the champ of Britain

They we can write as good as each other… lemme tell you some stuff this man has written

You battled Sniper E and pretended his name was Jim for the 3rd round

So you could do a 16 bar assosciative wordplay scheme on exercise… and tell them the battle wouldn't "work out"

Wait… and you think that we're the same… there's more quotes I'd mention

But it's embarrassing… cause that means you think Soul might've said

No… I edit

That round was more like a yoga class… you came dressed to exercise and spent the whole time stretching

But he said that… and he meant that

Cause he wrote that, and then read that

If that's the calibre of rapper that challenge to be the next champ

Tony shouldn't have thrown it away… he should have kept that

And in that same battle you saying you let the lead blam

You like hammers? West Ham, fight rappers, Def Jam,

So who's more real, the faggot in the sweatband

Or the dude who's willing to throw a punch and get banned

I can't make tracks like them man, but you can't clash like Jed can

So lucky for me, this ain't a drops or a web ham

It's right between your eyes, GSP with the headband

Blood everywhere turn the 7D to a Red cam

They wanna talk about his crop bringin bars to the scene

But I was there 2 years before tryna carve out that niche

Now you're part of it Cee, my marketing scheme

That got Major promoted… now the star gets fatigued I'm sergeant and chief

Now you're pardoning me? pardoning me

Be your part in the scene, is owed, part in to me, departing from me

So try parring with me, split my wig, that's a parting to me

A fake front but it sounds good, you're Dolly Parton to me

But I'm proud cause I gardened this seed, put bark this tree

Still you shouldn't bark up this tree, cause you try bite, but you aren't what you eat

I wore my heart on my sleeve, and watched my arteries bleed

So artists like Cee could come and take part in the league

If it wasn't for all my losses, you'd find it hard to succeed

This the spartan regime, in the arms of defeat, when the archers release

Act a god and get scarred for your cheek

Either 'I bury or move to M or it's over like Arsenal's team

I was here before Don't Flop Extra and the Demo Channel

Before the camera team, was Bam and Zeek and Fred and Bagnall

Back when Patty Boi's iPhone was the second angle

Back before you got bread to battle… back when you wouldn't even get your travel

You're from the 2012 killer crop...2012 killer crop?

Oh you mean 2012 only here cause of Mark Grist and Blizzard crop?

You mean 2012 driven on the road that we built you crop?

You mean 2012 bandwagon spitting cause the hits it got?

Bicker lots on Twitter crop, reason vets were quitting crop,

Cringy crop, whingy crop, seemed sick if you didn't flop

Cause you only had to compete with callumBOOM, eek, and Gibbo crop

About a killer crop, are you kidding dog? Some fucking nuclear winter crop

Cause like 4 of you herbs made it the rest of you fucking withered off

You stand out cause you've got a couple leaves in a crop of twigs and stalks

I'm that first event they did with Scots, here from the beginning crop

That's Chris and Tom, Gizmo, Kong, Deffinition, Don Silk and Shots, Scizzahz, Chron, Mr Wrong and Digits dog,

That's the difference, cause you think you're a vet I think I'm not

Just cause you can put people under you, like Micky, Locksmith and Dotz

And then they can put people under them, like Willzy, Shox, Twisted, Tox

And they can put people under them like, Dillon, Rob Wilson, Flawless and FOS

You on a high horse I'll kick you off… People ask why I'm humble, it's because

People could do the same to me... Like Piff and Hom

And people could do the same to them... Like Stig and Prof

And people could do the same to them... Jin and Swan

All the way back to fucking Kool Moe Dee at house parties in the Bronx

It's like you give them props, if they're hot, then sit and watch, them flip and flop

Like your disc I copped, Humble Beginnings stop, then they're the biggest shot

So this is where the killer crops, ego tripping stops

When I leave Cee red when I split his top he'll ditch the mosque for a synagogue

What you think this bar heavy, joke light, scene raised itself?

You think he seen Blizz and Grist go viral, then he came to help?

You think I'll let this bandwagon jumping, style biter, Cee claim the belt?

Then I got 2 words for all of you… Behave yourself…

CEE MAJOR
When he was in Canada this man got braggadocios

He said – and I quote this

"Fuck being Don’t Flop’s poster boy I’m captain of my own ship"

Now you’re back to get new highs by dragging on an old spliff

Because now you’re on them Don’t Flop posters, boy this man done had his tone switched

Before Tone dipped you were screaming "I don’t have to rep a league I move transcendentally"

Then you changed your tune

So the deal you and Organik made fell through and you’re back to beg it? Please

This man’s pathetic, if you’re not gonna rep a league, tell me what kind of champ that Jed can be

Let’s address how what you say and what you do just doesn’t match up

They say you the man with the words, but if you ain’t a man of your word

Then it’s all chat, cuz

Obviously you wanna be the champ, but

You say you don’t wanna represent a league?

Listed, that’s what a champ does

That’s why before this I was boys with Jed, so I’ve gotta destroy a friend

Because when there’s a virus in the system sometimes you’ve gotta cut off your own arm before the poison spreads

I’m on my star of David, every angle’s on point for them

I might scramble your brains like Freudian tests

When it’s grind time, I’m poised and penning a verse with a poison pen

And in Don’t Flop they saw us both grow from boys to men

But you’re on your Benjamin Button, you had to grow to this stage just to get boyed again

Like, how do you disrespect the company and get a title shot like they’re just giving it up

Doesn’t that pose one question? "Whose dick did he suck?"

‘cos this can’t be the type of fool that this brand serves

Then I guess it’s time for a revolution on the brand work

You’re overly emotional, you’re a battle rapper you’ve got a damn nerve

You’re getting drawn out for that heart on your sleeve like tat work

Because when this battle got announced, I had a death in the family

Last thing on my mind was Jed and the rap scene

So I grieved, felt depressed for a second then actually

I got to penning your funeral, you could never get at me

Because I’m a business man, so it’s fuck how I’m feeling and business as usual

Plus, they’re putting chips up, so if I chip chunks out of cuz then I can chip in for the funeral

But here’s where me and Soul stay different

Because when his dog died… Soul played victim

Cancelled his battle with Arkaic and had everyone asking if shit was okay with him

You’re weak… I ain’t okay with this

It’s time you drop Pesci’s style, adopt Cobain’s writtens

Take that Death Note of yours and jot your own name in it,

Because Soul’s ‘bout to get a whole new beating, I’m ‘bout to go crate digging.

And I’m sorry if you lot feel like I’m wrong for this angle

But you said depression helps you in battle rap? Not in this battle

Because If I say I’m ‘bout to top myself I brought lines to match my best shit

If he says he’s ‘bout to top himself I’m dialing paramedics

And if I’m talking dope, I mean I am that guy

If they’re talking dopamine, you lack that, right?

And I ain’t a Sadist I don’t say this for no reason

But depression runs your life, down to the cadence that you speak in

Talking like you believe you’re the greatest it’s deceiving

It’s degrading to the scene, your senior status is decreasing

Your life is defaced by depression this ain’t the face to rep the league with

Plus he’s moving sketchy when he claims to pledge allegiance

Now they know you in Canada, but do you think having a name is an achievement?

You’re in the pool with the big fish, round here being bait just gets you eaten

I’m on my predator shit

I’m a shark in the water, me and Soul (Sole) a whole different kettle of fish

You won’t make an impact with Cee, unless you allow your depression to win

And dive head first off the edge of a cliff

You lonely, depressed emotional wreck

Passive aggressive, manic depressive

Losing the company money because he can’t keep his emotions in check (cheque)

So how do you plan to sell a brand to the world

When a depressed little bitch is how he’s branding himself

While all of us hungry spitters are sat on the shelf

You lot are throwing him the rope… and he’s hanging himself

So as far as I’m concerned, Jed can get the belt

And you can have a champ tryna represent the league, that can’t even represent himself
